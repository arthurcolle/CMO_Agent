## Executive Summary

Q3 2023 will be remembered as the quarter when the long end finally broke. After months of relative range-trading in rates, the combination of the Fed's final hike, Treasury term premium repricing, and relentless supply concerns sent 10-year yields surging 73bps from 3.84% at the start of July to 4.57% by quarter-end—the highest level since 2007. Mortgage rates followed suit, with the 30-year conventional rate averaging 7.07% for the quarter and briefly touching 7.31% in late September. The housing market essentially froze, with turnover at generational lows as the lock-in effect calcified. For MBS investors, wider spreads offered some compensation, but negative convexity remains dormant at these rate levels. The basis to Treasuries widened as technicals deteriorated, Fed QT ground on relentlessly, and money managers rotated into higher-yielding alternatives. With the Fed likely done hiking and the curve finally beginning to normalize, the question for Q4 becomes whether we've seen peak rates—or merely a preview of the new normal.

## Rates: The Great Steepening

The rates move in Q3 was violent and unidirectional. Ten-year yields started July around 3.84%, briefly flirted with breaking below 3.75%, then began an unrelenting climb that accelerated into September. By month-end, the 10-year touched 4.57%—a 16-year high and a move that caught even the most hawkish desks flat-footed. This wasn't about near-term Fed policy (the July 26th hike was largely priced), but rather a dramatic repricing of term premium driven by Treasury supply fears, deficit concerns post-Fitch downgrade, and a growing recognition that "higher for longer" meant exactly that.

The Fed delivered its 25bp hike on July 26th, taking the funds rate to 5.25-5.50%, but Chair Powell's careful messaging suggested this was likely the terminal rate. The September FOMC delivered a hold as expected, though the dot plot kept one more hike on the table for late 2023—a hawkish hold that did nothing to stem the Treasury selloff. The 2s10s curve steepened dramatically from deeply inverted levels, moving from roughly -100bps to -75bps, though this was entirely driven by long-end weakness rather than any dovish repricing of the front end.

Fitch's August 1st downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt from AAA added fuel to the fire, though the move was more symbolic than substantive. What really mattered was the steady drumbeat of supply: massive Treasury auction sizes, deteriorating bid-to-covers, and growing foreign central bank reluctance to absorb marginal duration. Term premium, which had been negative or negligible for years, roared back into positive territory, creating a genuine risk premium for holding long-dated paper.

## Mortgage Rates: Seven Percent and Rising

Mortgage rates tracked the Treasury carnage higher, with the 30-year conventional rate averaging 7.07% for the quarter but showing troubling momentum into September. The Freddie Mac survey hit 7.23% in August and reached 7.31% by late September, levels not seen since the turn of the millennium. The 15-year fixed rate averaged 6.38%, offering minimal pickup to the 30-year on a monthly payment basis and thus seeing negligible uptake.

At these rate levels, the mortgage market bifurcates cleanly. For the 90%+ of borrowers sitting on sub-5% rates, refinancing makes zero economic sense barring life emergencies. The refi share collapsed to just 25% of origination volume, and what little refi activity remained was almost entirely cash-out—borrowers tapping equity to consolidate debt or fund major expenses, not rate-and-term refis chasing savings. Rate-and-term refi, the traditional driver of prepayment volatility, has effectively ceased to exist.

For new borrowers, 7%+ rates represent a brutal affordability shock. A $400K loan at 7.25% carries a monthly P&I payment of $2,728 versus $1,898 at 4.5%—an $830/month or 44% increase. Combined with elevated home prices (Case-Shiller still up 2.5% YoY despite the rate shock), the monthly payment required to buy a median home is at all-time highs relative to median income. Housing affordability is worse than any point in the post-war era, including the 1980s, once you adjust for price levels.

## MBS Technicals: QT Grinds On

The technical picture for agency MBS remained challenging throughout Q3. The Fed's balance sheet held approximately $2.49 trillion in MBS, down from the $2.7T+ peak, with $35 billion in monthly runoff continuing like clockwork. With gross issuance of only ~$220 billion for the quarter (roughly $73B/month), the Fed's passive runoff represents nearly half of gross supply being absorbed without replacement. This structural bid vacuum continued to weigh on valuations.

The current coupon spent most of the quarter between 6.0% and 6.5%, tracking higher with rates. MBS OAS widened to approximately 40bps versus like-duration Treasuries, wider than the mid-30s levels seen in Q2 but still inside the panic levels of late 2022. The widening reflected several factors: Fed QT, reduced money manager demand as corporates and Treasuries offered compelling alternatives, and bank portfolio paralysis (banks remain structurally long duration and underwater on legacy portfolios, thus unable to add aggressively).

Specified pool pay-ups essentially vanished. With mortgage rates at 7%+, low-loan-balance pools, high-LTV pools, investor pools, and other historically premium specifications offer zero prepayment protection because there's no prepayment risk to hedge. TBA liquidity remained adequate but not robust, with bid-asks widening modestly in the September selloff. Dollar rolls traded slightly special through quarter-end, reflecting decent dealer demand for inventory but nothing dramatic.

The basis to swaps widened in sympathy with the Treasury basis, as asset-swap spreads moved wider. For portfolio managers, MBS offered reasonable carry and dramatically better convexity profiles than in recent years (negative convexity being a concern only when rates might fall), but the opportunity cost versus corporates, CLOs, and even money-market instruments at 5.5% remained a tough hurdle.

## Housing Market: The Great Freeze

The housing market in Q3 can be summarized in one word: frozen. Existing home sales continued to languish near 4.0 million SAAR, roughly half the volumes seen during the 2020-2021 boom and the lowest sustained level since the mid-1990s (despite a U.S. population 30% larger). Inventory remained skeletal at just 3.3 months of supply, well below the 6 months typically considered balanced. The lock-in effect—where homeowners with sub-4% mortgages refuse to move and take on 7% financing—has become the dominant force in residential real estate.

Housing starts held up better at approximately 1.35 million SAAR, supported by build-to-rent activity, multi-family construction, and builders willing to buy down rates or offer incentives. But single-family starts for owner-occupancy showed clear weakness. The divergence between new and existing home sales continued, with builders gaining market share by necessity—if you want to buy a house, increasingly you're buying new construction because existing inventory simply isn't coming to market.

Home prices, remarkably, continued to rise. The Case-Shiller index showed 2.5% YoY appreciation, a testament to the supply-demand imbalance. Despite the worst affordability in history, prices haven't cratered because supply is even more constrained than demand. The marginal buyer is still buying (often relocating for work, upsizing with growing families, or all-cash), and with so few sellers, bidding wars persist in desirable markets.

Origination volumes totaled approximately $330 billion for the quarter, split roughly evenly between $170B in purchase and $160B in refi (almost entirely cash-out). For context, quarterly origination volumes in 2020-2021 frequently exceeded $1 trillion. The origination market has contracted by two-thirds, and the margin dollars available to lenders have cratered. Layoffs across mortgage banking have been brutal, with several large correspondent lenders exiting the business entirely.

## Agency Credit: GSEs Print Through the Drought

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued to demonstrate the durability of their credit positioning despite the origination drought. Fannie reported Q3 net income of approximately $4.8 billion, while Freddie posted $2.6 billion. The drivers were straightforward: near-zero credit losses (serious delinquency rates remain at historical lows), enormous back-book profitability (guarantees written at 3-4% coupons now deeply in-the-money), and modest but steady new business even at compressed volumes.

Credit performance across agency pools remained pristine. Delinquency rates continued to decline from already-low levels, and modification rates were negligible. The combination of massive home equity cushions (borrowers are sitting on trillions in aggregate equity), strong employment, and careful underwriting during the 2020-2021 boom has produced a credit book that's essentially bulletproof. Even if unemployment were to tick higher, the high equity positions and low payment burdens (for existing borrowers) provide enormous buffers.

The GSEs' capital positions continued to build under the FHFA's revised capital framework. Both entities now hold well over $100 billion in combined net worth, though still short of the fully built-out requirements under the Enterprise Regulatory Capital Framework (ERCF). The path to recap-and-release remains murky, with Washington gridlock and the 2024 election calendar making any near-term legislative solution unlikely. Still, the ongoing profitability demonstrates that the GSE model works—these are exceptionally profitable franchises when managed conservatively.

## Credit Risk Transfer: Normalizing After the Shock

The credit risk transfer (CRT) market showed continued signs of normalization in Q3, with both GSEs active issuers and spreads settling into a more rational range after the volatility of 2022. Fannie issued multiple CAS (Connecticut Avenue Securities) deals, while Freddie brought several STACR (Structured Agency Credit Risk) transactions. Investor demand was solid, particularly from hedge funds, insurance companies, and specialty credit managers seeking high-quality spread product.

CRT spreads compressed modestly from Q2 levels but remained wide of pre-pandemic tights, reflecting both the absolute level of risk-free rates (why reach for spread at 5.5% T-bills?) and lingering caution around housing. That said, the underlying credit fundamentals—low LTVs, strong borrower credit, negligible delinquencies—made the paper attractive on a risk-adjusted basis. Mezz and M2 tranches saw the most demand, offering 250-400bps over SOFR depending on vintage and structure.

The CRT market serves a critical function in the current environment, allowing the GSEs to distribute tail risk and satisfy FHFA capital requirements while investors gain exposure to mortgage credit without the duration and convexity baggage of MBS. With bank appetite for mortgage credit still constrained, CRT provides essential risk distribution capacity. Expect issuance to remain robust in Q4 and beyond.

## Outlook: Peak Rates or New Normal?

As we close the book on Q3, the critical question is whether 7%+ mortgage rates represent a peak or a new equilibrium. The bull case for lower rates rests on Fed policy: if the July hike was indeed the last, and inflation continues to moderate, the front end should remain anchored while term premium moderates. A 4% 10-year and 6.5% mortgages by mid-2024 is plausible if growth slows and the Fed begins telegraphing cuts.

The bear case argues that structurally higher deficits, persistent inflation, and a repricing of duration risk mean that 4-5% 10-year yields are the new normal—and thus 6.5-7.5% mortgages are here to stay. In this scenario, housing remains frozen, turnover stays depressed, and prepayments remain glacial for years. For MBS investors, this means collecting carry in a structurally attractive convexity environment but with limited price appreciation potential.

From a positioning perspective, current coupon MBS at 40bps OAS offer reasonable value for patient buyers, particularly given the dormant prepayment risk. Lower coupons (3s, 3.5s, 4s) remain "super-premium" trades for those willing to stomach the duration but offer compelling roll-down and limited downside given prepayment floors. Higher coupons (6s, 6.5s) trade rich to model given structural demand but offer cleaner exposure for those who believe rates have peaked.

The housing market will remain challenged into year-end and likely through 2024. Lock-in effects won't dissipate unless rates fall dramatically (unlikely) or time passes (years, not quarters). Origination volumes will remain depressed, and the industry will continue to consolidate. For the GSEs, profitability will persist but top-line growth will remain elusive. The mortgage market, like the housing market, is in suspended animation—profitable for incumbents, brutal for new entrants, and waiting for the next catalyst to break the stasis.
