# Q1 2016 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

The first quarter of 2016 delivered one of the most dramatic macro reversals in recent memory, transforming what appeared to be a measured tightening cycle into a full-blown dovish capitulation. After the Federal Reserve's December 2015 liftoff—their first hike in nearly a decade—global macro fears, collapsing oil prices, and emerging market stress triggered a violent flight-to-quality that crushed Treasury yields and fundamentally altered the mortgage landscape. The 10-year Treasury rallied nearly 75 basis points from year-end levels, touching 1.66% in February, while the Fed's dot plot underwent one of its most significant downgrades ever, slashing projected 2016 hikes from four to two. For MBS investors, this translated into a powerful refi wave, tightening spreads, and a renewed focus on prepayment protection as production coupons shifted decisively into 3.0% and 3.5% territory.

## Macro Environment and Rate Volatility

Q1 2016 will be remembered as the quarter when the Fed's normalization narrative collapsed under the weight of global deflationary pressures. January opened with a risk-off cascade: crude oil crashed below $30/barrel, Chinese equity markets triggered multiple circuit breakers, and credit spreads widened violently across HY and EM. The BOJ's shocking move to negative rates on January 29th only intensified the global easing narrative, sending shockwaves through currency and fixed income markets.

Against this backdrop, the FOMC went into full damage-control mode. Both the January and March meetings resulted in no action, with Chair Yellen adopting an increasingly dovish tone that emphasized downside risks to inflation and global growth headwinds. The March dot plot revision was particularly striking: the median 2016 projection fell from four hikes to just two, while the longer-run terminal rate estimate continued its inexorable drift lower. The 2s10s curve flattened approximately 35bps from December levels to settle around 105bps, reflecting market skepticism about the Fed's ability to normalize rates in any meaningful way.

The 10-year Treasury's journey from ~2.27% at year-end to a February low of 1.66% represented a stunning 60+ basis point rally in less than two months, with the quarterly average settling around 1.92%. This move had immediate and profound implications for mortgage rates, with the 30-year conforming rate dropping from approximately 4.01% at the end of 2015 to an average of 3.68% during Q1, while 15-year rates broke decisively below 3.00% to average 2.98%.

## MBS Technicals and Spread Performance

Despite—or perhaps because of—the violent rally in rates, Agency MBS spreads actually tightened during the quarter, with OAS compressing from the mid-20s to approximately 15bps by quarter-end. This performance reflected several competing dynamics. On one hand, the building refi wave and extension of duration created fundamental headwinds for generic MBS. On the other hand, the Fed's ongoing reinvestment program (maintaining their $1.75 trillion portfolio), constructive bank demand, and a general scarcity of high-quality spread product in a negative-yielding world provided powerful technical support.

Gross issuance surged to approximately $420 billion for the quarter, up substantially from Q4 2015 levels, as the refi machine began to roar back to life. Total mortgage originations reached roughly $350 billion, with the refi share spiking to 66% ($230B refi vs. $120B purchase). This represented one of the sharpest quarterly increases in refinancing activity since the taper tantrum recovery, and market participants quickly recognized that prepayment speeds would be a central theme for 2016.

The current coupon migrated decisively into 3.0% and 3.5% territory, creating a classic convexity challenge for MBS investors. As production shifted into these coupons, generic TBA underperformance became increasingly evident, particularly in faster-paying cohorts. This dynamic drove a meaningful pickup in specified pool pay-ups, with loan balance pay-ups rising approximately 1 point during the quarter as investors scrambled for prepayment protection.

## Specified Pools and Prepayment Protection

The violent rate rally and surging refi activity made Q1 2016 a breakout quarter for the specified pool market. With primary-secondary spreads compressing and millions of borrowers suddenly in-the-money, the value of prepayment protection surged across virtually all pay-up categories.

Loan balance pay-ups led the charge, with high-balance stories (particularly $400K+ and $500K+ pools) commanding pay-ups that rose roughly 1 point during the quarter. The logic was straightforward: in a refi wave environment, larger loan borrowers tend to be more rate-sensitive and face higher transaction costs as a percentage of loan size, while Fannie's loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs) on high-balance loans created additional friction.

Low FICO and high LTV stories also gained traction, though with more nuance. While these borrowers face refi hurdles, the counter-argument—that improving credit profiles and home price appreciation (Case-Shiller running +5.4% YoY) would eventually enable refinancing—tempered enthusiasm. Geography plays became increasingly sophisticated, with investors focusing on states with high transfer taxes, judicial foreclosure requirements, or other frictions that might slow prepayments.

New production 3.5% and 4.0% pools with burnout characteristics or specific geographic concentrations became particularly sought-after, as investors recognized that generic TBA in these coupons would likely experience significantly elevated speeds through 2016.

## GSE Financial Performance and Policy Developments

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac delivered solid Q1 results, with Fannie reporting net income of approximately $2.9 billion and Freddie posting $1.5 billion. These strong results reflected benign credit performance (90+ day delinquencies hovering around 1.8%, well off crisis peaks), rising home prices, and robust volumes.

The positive earnings trajectory continued to fuel debate around GSE reform and the future of conservatorship, though Q1 saw little concrete policy progress. The ongoing net worth sweep remained in place, with the GSEs' capital buffers continuing their scheduled decline toward zero by 2018. While various legislative proposals circulated, the approaching election year made meaningful reform increasingly unlikely in 2016.

From a credit risk transfer perspective, both GSEs continued to expand their CRT programs, with Freddie's STACR and Fannie's CAS platforms completing multiple transactions during the quarter. These deals remained attractively priced from the GSEs' perspective, as private capital proved willing to absorb significant first-loss exposure at spreads that appeared increasingly tight given the broader credit market volatility.

## Housing Market Fundamentals

The underlying housing market showed continued resilience during Q1, even as financial markets gyrated. Existing home sales ran at approximately 5.3 million seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR), while housing starts maintained a solid 1.15 million SAAR pace. These figures suggested the housing recovery remained intact, albeit at a measured pace constrained by tight inventory and affordability challenges in key markets.

The Case-Shiller national home price index posted 5.4% year-over-year appreciation, a healthy rate that supported credit quality without raising bubble concerns. Price appreciation continued to be geographically uneven, with West Coast markets and certain urban cores experiencing much stronger gains than secondary markets and rural areas.

The drop in mortgage rates during Q1 provided a tailwind for affordability, though this was partially offset by continued home price appreciation and stagnant wage growth in many markets. Purchase application activity showed modest improvement, but remained constrained by the structural factors that had plagued the housing market since the crisis: tight credit availability, limited inventory, changing demographics, and elevated student debt among younger potential buyers.

First-time homebuyer share remained stubbornly low relative to historical norms, while investor and cash purchases continued to represent outsized portions of transactions in many markets. These dynamics suggested that while the housing market was recovering, it remained far from "normal" by pre-crisis standards.

## Bank and Money Manager Positioning

MBS investor positioning evolved significantly during Q1 as the rate rally forced real-money accounts to reassess their convexity exposure. Banks, which had been reliable MBS buyers throughout 2014-2015, showed more selective interest during Q1, particularly as deposit growth moderated and balance sheet constraints remained binding for larger institutions. That said, the all-in yield on current coupon MBS remained attractive relative to similarly-rated alternatives, and regional banks continued to add mortgages opportunistically.

Money managers faced a more challenging environment. The combination of collapsing rates and surging refi expectations created a classic negative convexity trap for generic MBS portfolios. Many real-money accounts found themselves scrambling to reduce duration extension risk, either by rotating into lower coupons (accepting tighter spreads), increasing pay-up allocations, or adding derivatives overlays.

REIT portfolios experienced particular stress, as the rate rally created mark-to-market gains but also extended durations and reduced carry potential going forward. Some levered accounts took the opportunity to lock in gains and rotate toward more prepayment-protected product, while others maintained their generic TBA exposure and accepted the speed risk as the price of participating in spread tightening.

International demand remained a significant factor, with Japanese banks and life insurers continuing to allocate to Agency MBS as one of the few remaining sources of positive-yielding, high-quality spread product. The BOJ's move to negative rates only intensified this bid, as Japanese institutions faced increasingly desperate searches for yield.

## Credit Performance and Delinquencies

Credit performance across the Agency universe remained exceptionally strong throughout Q1, with 90+ day delinquency rates around 1.8% and showing continued gradual improvement. This benign credit environment reflected the combination of conservative underwriting since 2009, robust home price appreciation, and an improving labor market.

Vintage performance analysis showed 2012-2015 originations performing exceptionally well, with minimal delinquency development and strong prepayment profiles. Even crisis-vintage loans (2005-2008) showed continued healing, as rising home prices pulled underwater borrowers back to positive equity and HARP refinancing programs allowed many distressed borrowers to reduce their payments.

The geographic distribution of credit stress continued to normalize, with former sand states (Florida, Arizona, Nevada) showing dramatic improvement from crisis peaks. Some pockets of weakness remained in energy-dependent markets as oil prices collapsed, but these represented a small portion of the overall Agency universe and had not yet translated into meaningful delinquency spikes.

Loss severity metrics remained elevated relative to pre-crisis norms, reflecting the extended timelines for liquidating foreclosures in judicial states and the ongoing effect of various loss mitigation programs. However, with delinquency rates so low, total loss content across the Agency universe was minimal and declining.

## Outlook and Strategic Implications

As we move into Q2 2016, the mortgage market faces a fundamentally altered landscape. The Fed's dovish pivot has effectively removed the tightening tailwind that MBS investors had anticipated, while the refi wave has only begun to gather momentum. Primary-secondary spreads remain conducive to refis, and our internal models suggest that roughly $300-400 billion of outstanding mortgages are in-the-money at current rates.

For MBS investors, this environment demands a more defensive positioning than appeared necessary just three months ago. Generic TBA in production coupons faces significant speed risk, and we expect continued outperformance from specified pools with legitimate prepayment protection. Pay-ups may continue to grind tighter, but the alternative—accepting 15%+ CPR on generic product—appears materially worse.

Spread levels around 15bps OAS offer limited cushion for negative convexity, particularly if the Fed remains on hold for an extended period and rates grind lower. We see more value in defensive structures: 15-year paper, lower coupons (2.5% and 3.0% with pay-ups), and specified pools with geographic or borrower characteristics that legitimately slow prepayments.

The global macro environment remains the wild card. If deflationary pressures persist and the Fed remains pinned at 25-50bps, mortgages could face an extended period of prepayment headwinds. Conversely, any rebound in growth expectations or inflation could quickly reverse the Q1 rate rally, leaving investors who rotated too defensively facing underperformance.

What seems clear is that 2016 will not be the year of gradual normalization that markets priced in December. The Fed has been forced back into a holding pattern, global central banks are competing in a race to the bottom, and mortgage investors must navigate an environment where traditional defensive assets offer little defense at all. In this context, security selection, careful convexity management, and realistic prepayment modeling have never been more critical.
