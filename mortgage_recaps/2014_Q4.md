# Q4 2014 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

The fourth quarter of 2014 proved to be one of the most eventful periods for agency MBS in recent memory, marking a definitive transition away from the Fed's quantitative easing era while simultaneously delivering one of the most dramatic rate rallies of the cycle. Despite widespread concerns heading into the quarter about how agency MBS would perform post-QE3, the asset class demonstrated remarkable resilience. The 10-year Treasury rallied sharply from ~2.50% to close the year around 2.17%, driven by a toxic cocktail of global growth concerns, collapsing oil prices, and European deflation fears. The 30-year mortgage rate followed suit, averaging approximately 4.00% for the quarter and touching 3.80% in October—levels not seen since mid-2013. Against this backdrop, the Fed successfully ended QE3 on October 29th without disrupting market function, agency MBS spreads remained well-behaved, and specified pool pay-ups actually expanded as convexity concerns eased. For MBS investors, Q4 2014 was characterized by three key themes: navigating the post-QE landscape, managing the October 15th flash rally, and positioning for the inevitable Fed liftoff signaled by December's "patient" language.

## Rates and Fed Policy: QE3's Graceful Exit

The Federal Reserve successfully executed its exit from quantitative easing on October 29th, bringing QE3 to a close after accumulating approximately $1.78 trillion in agency MBS. The October FOMC meeting marked this milestone while simultaneously introducing forward guidance that kept markets calm: the Committee would maintain its $1.78T MBS portfolio through reinvestments of principal payments, ensuring continued technical support for the sector. This reinvestment policy proved critical in anchoring MBS basis levels post-QE.

The December FOMC meeting introduced the now-famous "patient" language regarding the timing of rate liftoff, effectively communicating that the first hike wouldn't occur at the subsequent two meetings. This dovish twist, combined with Chair Yellen's press conference comments emphasizing data-dependency, helped drive the 2s10s curve toward 175bps—a notable flattening that reflected market skepticism about the Fed's ability to normalize quickly.

The backdrop for these policy shifts was a dramatic rally in rates that caught most strategists flat-footed. The 10-year Treasury averaged approximately 2.27% for the quarter but experienced violent intraday moves, most notably the October 15th flash rally when yields plunged to 2.07% intraday—a stunning 34bp move that remains one of the largest single-day swings in modern Treasury market history. While explanations ranged from technical factors to algorithm-driven flows, the move highlighted structural changes in Treasury market liquidity that would have lasting implications.

## MBS Technicals: Defying the Skeptics

Heading into Q4, the consensus view was decidedly bearish on MBS technicals. With the Fed stepping away as the marginal buyer of $40+ billion monthly, many forecasters predicted meaningful cheapening of MBS spreads. Instead, agency MBS delivered one of the year's most positive surprises, with option-adjusted spreads remaining remarkably stable in the 90-110bp range for current coupon production.

Several factors drove this resilience. First, the Fed's reinvestment policy—running at approximately $15-20 billion monthly depending on prepayment speeds—provided more support than initially appreciated. Second, money managers and real estate investment trusts stepped up as buyers, attracted by improved relative value versus corporates and CLOs. Third, and perhaps most importantly, bank demand for MBS remained robust as Basel III liquidity coverage ratio requirements drove structural bid for high-quality liquid assets.

Agency MBS issuance totaled approximately $310 billion gross for the quarter, representing healthy but not overwhelming supply. The primary/secondary differential remained tight, typically inside 4-5 ticks, reflecting solid dealer distribution capabilities even without the Fed backstop. Remarkably, this smooth digestion occurred during a period when duration extension was a legitimate concern given the rate rally.

The current coupon migrated down-in-coupon during the quarter, with 3.0% and 3.5% MBS coming into play as production coupons by year-end. This created opportunities for coupon-swapping strategies, as investors rotated out of 4.0%s into higher-dollar-price securities with better convexity profiles. The 30-year 3.5% cohort, trading in the 103-104 range, emerged as the consensus overweight by December.

## Specified Pools: Pay-ups Expand as Convexity Fears Recede

One of Q4's more counterintuitive developments was the expansion of specified pool pay-ups despite—or perhaps because of—the sharp rally in rates. With mortgage rates dropping approximately 40-50bps from early October through year-end, prepayment concerns would typically compress pay-ups for low-loan-balance, high-FICO, and geographic-specific pools. Instead, pay-ups expanded across most cohorts.

The explanation lies in the convexity dynamics. As rates rallied and generic TBAs became negatively convex (with durations extending from the high-4s toward 6.0 for current coupons), specified pools with prepayment protection became increasingly valuable as hedging instruments. Low-loan-balance pools in 3.5% and 4.0% coupons saw pay-ups expand from the 1-00 to 1-50 range in September to 2-00+ by December. High LTV specifications, which had been out of favor for much of 2014, also saw renewed interest as their negative convexity characteristics actually provided attractive yields without meaningfully worse extension risk than generic pools.

New York and California geographic pools commanded premium pay-ups of 1-50 to 3-00+ depending on coupon and vintage, as these high-cost areas featured loan balances near or at conforming limits, reducing refinanceability. The FHFA's announcement that 2015 conforming limits would remain at $417,000 actually supported these pay-ups by eliminating concerns about "jumbo compression" where previously conforming loans might become jumbo if limits were reduced.

Investor-property pools, which had traded at discounts earlier in the year due to credit concerns, began recovering as delinquency rates continued their secular decline toward 2.7% for 90+ day buckets. By year-end, the specified pool market had evolved into a highly segmented, specialist-driven arena where information advantages and prepayment modeling capabilities could generate meaningful alpha.

## Housing and Origination: Stabilization and Mix Shift

The housing market delivered mixed signals during Q4 2014. Existing home sales ran at approximately 5.1 million SAAR—a respectable level representing healthy year-over-year growth but short of the robust acceleration some had forecast. Housing starts climbed toward 1.06 million SAAR, suggesting steady progress in addressing supply constraints, though multifamily construction continued to outpace single-family activity. Case-Shiller home price appreciation decelerated to approximately 4.7% year-over-year, representing a normalization from the double-digit gains of 2013 and suggesting a healthier, more sustainable trajectory.

Mortgage origination volumes for Q4 totaled approximately $285 billion, with an interesting split: purchase originations ran at roughly $140 billion while refinance activity accounted for $145 billion, representing a 51% refi share. This marked a notable shift from Q3, as the October rate decline catalyzed a mini-refi wave. Borrowers who had been priced out of refinancing in 2014's higher rate environment found themselves back "in the money," creating a brief surge in application activity.

The composition of originations also shifted, with conventional conforming maintaining its dominant position while FHA share continued its gradual decline from peak levels. Credit remained tight by historical standards—FICO scores for new originations averaged in the mid-740s—but there were nascent signs of easing, particularly in portfolio and non-QM channels. Lender margins remained compressed as competitive dynamics intensified, with correspondent channels particularly aggressive in pricing to maintain volume.

## Credit and GSE Reform: Incremental Progress

The GSE credit picture continued its steady improvement throughout Q4. Fannie Mae reported approximately $4.6 billion in net income for the quarter, bringing full-year 2014 earnings to roughly $14.2 billion. Freddie Mac posted approximately $2.8 billion for Q4, contributing to another profitable year. Legacy credit losses continued their inexorable decline as modification programs matured and the remaining distressed inventory worked through the system. The 90+ day delinquency rate dropped to approximately 2.7%, approaching pre-crisis levels for recent vintages.

Perhaps the most significant development was the continued expansion of credit risk transfer programs. For full-year 2014, the GSEs issued approximately $9 billion in CRT securities across various structures—STACR from Freddie and CAS from Fannie. These transactions successfully transferred meaningful first-loss and mezzanine risk to private capital, demonstrating that market appetite existed for GSE credit risk when appropriately structured and priced. The spreads at which these deals cleared—typically L+500 to L+900 depending on attachment point—provided important price discovery and suggested that private capital was willing to bear mortgage credit risk at yields substantially below what most had predicted.

On the policy front, the most consequential development was Mel Watt's decision to halt scheduled g-fee increases, breaking with his predecessor's approach. This decision sparked vigorous debate: supporters argued that the GSEs shouldn't be used as fiscal policy instruments to offset budget deficits, while critics contended that below-market g-fees represented continued taxpayer subsidy. Regardless of one's view, the decision had immediate implications for lender economics and signaled Watt's willingness to assert FHFA independence.

Comprehensive GSE reform remained stalled in Congress, with the Johnson-Crapo bill failing to gain traction and partisan disagreements precluding compromise. The realization set in that conservatorship would likely continue for several more years, leading many market participants to focus on administrative reforms rather than legislative solutions.

## The Oil Crash and Global Macro: Exogenous Shocks

No discussion of Q4 2014 would be complete without addressing the oil price collapse that dominated headlines and drove much of the rates market volatility. Brent crude plunged from approximately $115 per barrel in June to $55 by year-end, with the bulk of the decline concentrated in Q4. This historic move reflected oversupply driven by U.S. shale production, OPEC's decision not to cut output, and weakening global demand—particularly from China and Europe.

The implications for rates markets were profound. Lower oil prices represented both disinflationary pressure (dragging headline CPI toward zero) and potential demand destruction in energy-dependent sectors. Markets began pricing material downside risk to Fed rate hike expectations, with Fed Funds futures pushing the expected liftoff date later into 2015. The 10-year Treasury rallied sharply as global capital sought safety, with European sovereign yields grinding toward zero and Japanese yields remaining anchored by BOJ policy.

For MBS investors, the oil shock presented both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, the rally in rates was unambiguously positive for MBS returns, with current coupon securities posting total returns in the high single digits for the quarter. On the other hand, the prepayment and convexity implications required careful navigation. The key insight was recognizing that mortgage rates, while lower, hadn't declined sufficiently to trigger massive refinance waves—the "refi wall" remained largely intact, with the bulk of outstanding loans still carrying rates well above 4.00%.

## Positioning and Strategy: Navigating Year-End

As Q4 progressed, investor positioning evolved through several distinct phases. October began with many accounts defensively positioned given QE3's impending end, holding short duration and avoiding negative convexity. The October 15th flash rally forced rapid repositioning, with underweight accounts scrambling to add duration and many dealers caught with insufficient inventory. November saw consolidation and debate about whether the rally had legs or represented a technical overshooting. December brought year-end dynamics, with REITs dividend-timing their purchases, banks managing HQLA ratios, and many accounts reluctant to chase given rich valuations.

From a structural perspective, several strategies gained favor. Coupon-swapping from 4.0%s and 4.5%s into 3.5%s and 3.0%s captured roll-down and improved convexity profiles. Specified pool sleeves were expanded to mitigate extension risk, with particular focus on low-loan-balance and geographic cohorts. Some accounts implemented curve-flattening trades, pairing long MBS positions against 7-year or 10-year Treasury shorts based on the view that the Fed's "patient" language capped front-end rates while term premium remained anchored.

The relative value debate centered on MBS versus investment-grade corporates and ABS. With corporate spreads tightening to post-crisis wides and CLO spreads grinding in, current coupon MBS at 100-110bp over swaps appeared increasingly attractive. The liquidity premium embedded in MBS—as evidenced by the October 15th episode—was a concern, but most investors concluded that the incremental yield and convexity optionality justified the position.

## Outlook: Setting Up for 2015

As 2014 drew to a close, the setup for 2015 appeared constructive for agency MBS, albeit with meaningful risks. The base case envisioned the Fed maintaining its "patient" stance through mid-2015, followed by a gradual, well-telegraphed rate hike cycle beginning in the summer or fall. Under this scenario, MBS spreads would likely remain range-bound, with technical support from Fed reinvestments, bank HQLA demand, and money manager flows offsetting the modest headwind from dealer balance sheet constraints and regulatory capital charges.

The primary upside risk was a sharper-than-expected slowdown in domestic or global growth that would keep the Fed on hold indefinitely and drive further rally in rates. While this would deliver strong MBS total returns in the near term, the extension risk and eventual reconvergence would be painful. The primary downside risk was an inflation surprise—perhaps from wage growth or a reversal in oil prices—that forced the Fed to accelerate normalization, widening MBS spreads and generating negative convexity losses.

For specified pools, the outlook remained bright. With generic TBA durations elevated and prepayment dispersion likely to persist given tight underwriting standards and the concentration of outstanding loans with rates above 4.50%, the market appeared poised to support healthy pay-up levels throughout 2015. Credit risk transfer issuance was expected to expand, potentially reaching $15-20 billion, as the GSEs refined their execution strategies and investor familiarity grew.

The overarching theme heading into 2015 was normalization—of Fed policy, housing market dynamics, origination volumes, and MBS investor behavior. The extraordinary measures of the crisis and recovery era were gradually giving way to more traditional market structures. For sell-side strategists and buy-side investors alike, the challenge would be adapting to this new environment while remaining vigilant for the inevitable volatility that accompanies major regime changes. Q4 2014 provided an important preview: even in a world without Fed QE, agency MBS remained a resilient, attractively valued sector capable of delivering solid risk-adjusted returns.
