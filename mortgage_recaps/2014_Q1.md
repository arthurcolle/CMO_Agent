# Q1 2014 Mortgage Market Recap

**Period:** January 1 - March 31, 2014
**Desk:** Agency MBS Strategy
**Author:** Sell-Side Primary Dealer Research

> *This is the first in a series of 48 quarterly mortgage market recaps covering Q1 2014 through Q4 2025. Across this 12-year arc, six interconnected feedback loops define the mortgage complex: (1) **Fed balance sheet ↔ MBS basis** — from QE3 taper to QT to GSE retained portfolio purchases, the marginal buyer of agency MBS changes everything; (2) **Rates ↔ prepayments ↔ convexity ↔ rates** — the reflexive loop where rate shocks trigger duration extension, forcing hedging flows that amplify the move; (3) **Lock-in effect ↔ inventory ↔ prices ↔ affordability** — a housing freeze feedback that won't fully manifest until 2022 but whose roots are planted here; (4) **Origination volume ↔ MBS supply ↔ basis ↔ Fed demand** — the technical supply/demand picture that drives spread levels; (5) **Credit quality ↔ CRT pricing ↔ GSE capital ↔ privatization path** — from CRT's pilot year to the eventual privatization blueprint; (6) **Non-agency recovery ↔ credit box ↔ housing access ↔ agency dominance** — the slow rebuild of private-label markets from post-crisis rubble. Watch for these loops across all 48 quarters.*

## 1. Rates & Yield Curve

Q1 marked a relief rally after 2013's taper tantrum bloodbath, though the reprieve proved temporary and unconvincing. The 10yr Treasury opened the year at 3.0% on January 2nd—a level that felt punitive after spending most of 2012 below 2%—before grinding lower to 2.72% by quarter-end. The 30yr mortgage rate followed suit, averaging 4.35% for the quarter but showing meaningful compression from 4.53% in January to 4.32% by March. This 21bp improvement was welcomed by originators nursing wounds from the prior quarter's carnage, though it did little to revive the moribund refinance market.

The Fed maintained its zero bound (0-0.25%) throughout Q1, a policy now in its sixth year and showing no signs of conclusion despite the ongoing taper. The 2s10s curve steepened modestly to 230bps, reflecting market acceptance of Fed tightening timelines pushed well into 2015 or beyond. Yellen's coronation as Chair on February 3rd and her first FOMC meeting on March 18-19th reinforced continuity—the committee maintained its "considerable time" language regarding eventual liftoff, even as it continued methodically reducing asset purchases.

Volatility remained suppressed relative to 2013's chaos. The move from 3.0% to 2.72% in 10s was orderly, driven by soft economic data (weather was the convenient excuse), mixed employment prints, and persistent global disinflationary pressures. The curve's steep configuration was a gift to carry trades and created an environment where MBS could perform respectably on a hedged basis, though the absolute level of rates continued to strangle refinance activity.

## 2. Agency MBS Market

The agency MBS market entered 2014 in a schizophrenic state: fundamentally impaired by collapsing refi activity but technically supported by a Fed balance sheet still expanding at $35B/month in January. The current coupon traded in the 4.0-4.5% stack, with production concentrating in these coupons as rates stabilized around 4.35%. Option-adjusted spreads compressed to 10-15bps on current coupon pools—levels that would have been laughable in 2011 but represented the new normal under Fed dominance.

Gross issuance of $375B for the quarter represented an 18% YoY decline, reflecting the structural shift from a refi-driven market to a purchase-money dominated one. This transition is the story of 2014 and beyond. The days of $500B+ quarterly issuance are over absent a dramatic rate rally (don't hold your breath) or another housing bubble (please, no).

TBA liquidity remained robust despite lower issuance, as the Fed's continued presence and dealer hedging activity kept markets functioning smoothly. Specified pool trading picked up as investors hunted for prepayment protection in a world where voluntary refi speeds were collapsing but the memory of 2013's duration extension remained fresh. Low loan balance pools, high FICO cohorts, and investor property collateral all commanded meaningful pay-ups.

The Fed's taper cadence—$35B in January, $30B in February, $25B in March—was telegraphed and digested without incident. Markets took comfort in Yellen's dovish credibility and the fact that even at $25B/month, the Fed was still absorbing nearly 80% of net new supply. This is price-insensitive demand at scale, and it kept basis levels compressed well inside historical norms. When the Fed eventually exits, the repricing will be violent.

## 3. GSE & Regulatory

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued their roles as undead government wards, generating profits ($3.5B and $2.0B respectively in Q1) that flowed entirely to Treasury under the net worth sweep imposed in 2012. The GSEs' retained capital stood at precisely zero, their purpose reduced to facilitating credit flow while Congress engaged in its sixth consecutive year of promising reform and delivering nothing.

The big regulatory story of Q1 was the continued rollout of credit risk transfer (CRT) programs. Freddie's STACR 2014-DN1 priced in February and Fannie's CAS 2014-C01 in January, building on the 2013 pilots. These transactions—synthetic and cash, respectively—represented the GSEs' attempt to offload tail risk to private capital, satisfying FHFA directives while creating a new asset class for credit-hungry investors. Spreads were tight by historical default probability standards but attractive relative to corporate credit, and the deals were well-received. Expect issuance to accelerate; FHFA wants to see meaningful risk transfer, and the GSEs are complying.

The qualified mortgage (QM) and ability-to-repay (ATR) rules went into effect January 10th, representing Dodd-Frank's most significant impact on origination standards. The QM safe harbor—requiring debt-to-income ratios below 43% and prohibiting certain risky features—effectively codified what GSE underwriting already demanded. The rule's primary impact was on non-QM jumbo and portfolio products, where it created uncertainty and reduced supply. One quarter in, the sky hasn't fallen, but the rule's long-term effect of cementing GSE dominance (QM loans get liability protection, non-QM loans face litigation risk) became increasingly apparent.

The conforming loan limit remained at $417,000, a cap imposed in 2006 and maintained through a housing cycle that saw prices collapse and recover. In high-cost areas, the ceiling felt increasingly binding as home price appreciation—still running 13% YoY per Case-Shiller—pushed more borrowers into jumbo territory.

## 4. Origination & Primary Market

Origination volume of $235B in Q1 was dismal, representing a 35% QoQ decline and the weakest quarter since Q2 2011. The culprits were multiple: rates up 100bps from 2013 lows killed refinance activity, the polar vortex froze the Midwest and East Coast (literally), and the taper tantrum's hangover effects continued reverberating through purchase demand. Refinance share fell to 49% of applications, down from 57% in Q4 and 70%+ in early 2013. The great refi wave was officially over.

Purchase originations of $120B actually represented the bright spot, holding up better than refis on a relative basis. The purchase market is now the marginal driver of MBS supply, a structural shift that changes everything about how we think about issuance, prepayments, and convexity. Purchase borrowers don't refi at the first opportunity; they're buying homes, not trading options.

Primary-secondary spreads widened modestly as originators rebuilt margins crushed during the 2013 refi boom. With volume down sharply, fixed costs had to be spread across fewer units, and lenders weren't shy about repricing. The 30yr mortgage rate's spread to 10yr Treasuries averaged 160bps, inside the 175bp levels seen at the peak of taper tantrum but wider than the 130-140bp compression during refi mania.

Credit quality remained pristine. Average FICO scores on new originations stayed above 740, down payment ratios were healthy, and debt-to-income levels were conservative. This wasn't entirely by choice—tight underwriting standards, ATR rules, and lenders' fear of putback liability created a regime where only the most creditworthy borrowers could access leverage. First-time homebuyers, historically the marginal price-setters in housing, remained frozen out by tight credit and high prices.

## 5. Prepayment & Convexity

Prepayment speeds collapsed in Q1, with voluntary refi activity grinding to near-zero levels as rate incentive evaporated. CPR speeds on current production cohorts (2013-2014 vintage 4.0s and 4.5s) ran in the high single digits, while seasoned discount stacks barely registered a pulse. This was the flipside of the 2013 refi tsunami: borrowers who could refinance already had, and those remaining in higher coupons were either locked out by credit/documentation issues or sitting on loans too small to justify transaction costs.

The collapse in speeds was a gift to MBS investors who'd suffered through negative convexity in 2012-13, but it created a new problem: extension risk. As rates backed up in 2013, durations extended violently, forcing portfolio managers to buy expensive swaptions or eat the duration increase. In Q1, rates rallied modestly, providing some relief, but the specter of extension remained. Investors began focusing on buy-and-hold profiles rather than gambling on refi optionality.

Convexity hedging flows were muted compared to 2013's chaos. With speeds low and stable, GSEs and mortgage REITs weren't forced into panicked Treasury sales to rebalance duration. This technical tailwind helped rates rally in Q1—when MBS portfolios aren't vomiting Treasuries, curves can compress. The question is what happens when rates eventually rise meaningfully again. The embedded short rate option in MBS hasn't disappeared; it's just dormant.

Specified pool pay-ups reflected the market's obsession with prepayment protection. Low loan balance pools (sub-$200K) traded 50-100bp rich to TBA, reflecting their propensity to prepay slower due to transaction costs overwhelming rate incentive. High FICO pools commanded similar premiums, as did investor property and second home collateral (ineligible for HARP). In a world where refi speeds are structurally lower, these characteristics matter less, but the market was still paying up for protection.

## 6. Housing & Credit

The housing market's momentum from 2013's explosive recovery stalled in Q1, though it was difficult to disentangle fundamental softness from weather-related disruptions. The polar vortex—a marketing-friendly term for "it was really cold"—paralyzed the Midwest and East Coast for weeks, shutting down showings, inspections, and closings. Existing home sales fell 7% QoQ to 4.6M SAAR, while housing starts dropped 5% to 920K SAAR. Bulls blamed weather; bears saw affordability constraints and rising rates taking their toll.

Case-Shiller home price appreciation remained elevated at 13.2% YoY, though the rate of increase was clearly decelerating from 2013's peak. Phoenix, Las Vegas, and California metros that led the recovery saw appreciation slow as investors pulled back and organic buyer demand couldn't sustain the pace. Prices were up massively from the 2012 trough—35-40% in many markets—but nowhere near prior peaks in inflation-adjusted terms. The recovery had been V-shaped in price, but transaction volumes remained depressed, suggesting a market still finding equilibrium.

Credit quality metrics continued improving. The 90+ day delinquency rate fell to 3.5%, down 30bps from Q4 and miles inside the 8%+ peaks of 2009-10. Foreclosure pipelines were clearing, modification programs had done their work, and new originations were pristine. The GSEs' credit losses continued declining, supporting their profitability even as guarantee fee income flattened with lower volumes.

First-time homebuyers remained AWOL, representing just 28-30% of purchases versus a historical norm of 40%+. Tight credit, student loan burdens, high prices, and scarce entry-level inventory kept them sidelined. Investors and all-cash buyers still dominated in many markets, creating a two-tier system: liquid markets for institutional-grade product and stagnation everywhere else.

## 7. Non-Agency & Structured Products

The non-agency RMBS market continued its slow thaw from permafrost, though issuance remained microscopic relative to the 2005-07 bubble years. Q1 saw roughly $2-3B of new non-agency deals, primarily jumbo prime collateral from well-capitalized originators targeting high-net-worth borrowers outside GSE boxes. Credit spreads remained tight—high-grade tranches priced at LIBOR +125-150bps—reflecting the scarcity value of yield in a zero-rate world.

Legacy non-agency bonds continued grinding tighter as credit performance exceeded expectations and the trustee/litigation overhang slowly resolved. Senior bonds that traded in the 70s-80s in 2012 were now at par or premium, while mezzanine tranches saw spectacular gains as loss severities came in well below initial model assumptions. Hedge funds that bought distressed non-agency in 2009-11 posted eye-watering returns and began rotating into new niches.

CMBS issuance totaled $22B for the quarter, a respectable figure representing continued recovery in commercial real estate lending. Conduit deals were back, though structures remained cleaner than pre-crisis vintage (less leverage, more subordination, better reporting). The hunt for yield pushed spreads tighter, with AAA tranches inside LIBOR +90bps. It wasn't quite frothy, but it was getting there.

The GSE credit risk transfer deals (STACR, CAS) mentioned earlier represent a hybrid category—technically structured products but with agency collateral. These quickly became a favorite among credit investors looking for floating-rate exposure, home price beta, and yields in the 300-500bp range depending on tranche. The market's receptivity to these deals was a proof of concept; expect $20-30B of CRT issuance in 2014.

## 8. Key Events & Narrative

Q1 2014's narrative arc was defined by three forces: the Fed's methodical taper, Janet Yellen's smooth transition to Chair, and weather disruptions that provided convenient cover for housing weakness. The quarter began with anxiety about continued taper—would the Fed blink with data softening?—but Yellen's March meeting made clear the path was set. The $10B reduction in monthly MBS purchases from January ($35B) to March ($25B) was executed flawlessly, with markets barely flinching. This speaks to the Fed's communication strategy and the market's acceptance that even $25B/month is massive support.

Yellen's February 3rd swearing-in and March 18-19th first FOMC meeting as Chair reinforced continuity with Bernanke's policies. She's more dovish on the margin, more focused on employment than inflation, and unlikely to surprise markets with hawkish pivots. This was reassuring to MBS investors who'd lived through 2013's volatility and craved predictability.

The polar vortex became the quarter's dominant housing narrative—arguably over-emphasized but undeniably impactful. Sub-zero temperatures and record snowfall across major population centers shut down real estate activity for weeks. January and February home sales were particularly weak, with some recovery in March as weather normalized. The question going into Q2 was whether activity would bounce back (the weather camp) or whether 4.3% rates and elevated prices had fundamentally impaired affordability (the structural bear camp). We'd get our answer soon.

The origination market's collapse forced lenders into cost-cutting mode. Layoffs hit retail and correspondent channels hard, with some shops shutting down entirely. The survivors raised margins and focused on purchase money business, which was less rate-sensitive and offered relationship opportunities for cross-sell. The industry was right-sizing after the 2012-13 sugar rush, and it was painful.

Looking forward, the remainder of 2014 would be defined by whether housing could stabilize at higher rates, whether the Fed could complete its taper without market disruption, and whether wage growth could finally materialize to support home price appreciation. Q1 didn't answer these questions, but it set the stage for what would be a year of transition from stimulus-driven recovery to self-sustaining expansion. Whether that transition succeeds remains the $1.6 trillion question—literally, given the size of the Fed's MBS portfolio.

## Conclusion

Q1 2014 was a quarter of adjustment and repricing. The refi market died, the Fed tapered without incident, and housing took a weather-induced breather. MBS technicals remained supportive thanks to Fed buying, but fundamentals weakened as origination volumes collapsed. The transition from a refi-driven to purchase-driven market is structural and permanent (at current rate levels), changing the character of MBS cash flows and investor positioning. We're constructive on MBS versus duration given still-attractive carry and Fed support, but wary of extension risk if rates back up meaningfully. The next crisis won't look like the last one, but when Fed purchases eventually end, the market will need to reprice for new realities. That day is still 12-18 months away—plenty of time to collect carry and worry later.

**Recommendation:** Overweight current coupon MBS versus 10yr duration, emphasize specified pools for prepayment protection, maintain hedges against extension risk.

> **Feedback loop watch:** The Fed's $1.6T MBS portfolio is the market's price-insensitive bid. When it eventually stops growing (taper completes Q4 2014) and eventually shrinks (QT, eventually), the repricing will be violent — we'll see this in 2017-2018 QT and again in 2022's historic OAS blowout. CRT's nascent $3-5B issuance program is building the architecture that will eventually accumulate $100B+ in transferred credit risk and become central to the GSE privatization debate a decade from now. And specified pool pay-ups at 50-100bps today will look quaint compared to both their expansion in 2019-2021's refi wave and their total annihilation in 2022's rate shock. The convexity embedded in these instruments — the short option that MBS investors are paid to hold — is dormant at 4.35% rates. It will awaken.
