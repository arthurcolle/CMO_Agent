# Q4 2019 Mortgage Market Recap

**Period: October 1 - December 31, 2019**

---

## Executive Summary

The fourth quarter of 2019 marked a constructive conclusion to an eventful year for Agency MBS, characterized by the Fed's strategic pause following three "mid-cycle adjustment" rate cuts, a meaningful backup in Treasury yields from summer lows, and continued robust housing fundamentals. The 30-year mortgage rate held steady around 3.68% for the quarter, ending the year at 3.66%—substantially lower than the ~4.60% levels that had chilled demand in Q4 2018. This rate environment, combined with stabilized trade tensions following the Phase 1 China deal and record conforming loan limits for 2020, fueled an extraordinary refinancing wave that pushed refi share to approximately 66% of total origination. MBS spreads tightened further to ~22bps OAS despite elevated gross issuance of $360B, as technicals remained supportive with the Fed's portfolio in gentle runoff mode and specified pool pay-ups trading at elevated levels. The successful UMBS transition was now fully in the rearview mirror, and market participants turned their attention to the FHFA's re-proposed GSE capital rule and the implications for 2020 supply-demand dynamics.

## Rate Environment and Fed Policy

The Federal Reserve's policy evolution in Q4 defined the interest rate backdrop for mortgage markets. On October 30, the FOMC delivered its third consecutive 25bp rate cut, bringing the fed funds target range down to 1.50-1.75%. Importantly, Chair Powell characterized these moves as "insurance cuts" designed to sustain the economic expansion in the face of global growth concerns and trade uncertainty—not the beginning of an extended easing cycle. The December 11 FOMC meeting produced a unanimous decision to hold rates steady, with forward guidance shifting decisively toward a higher bar for further action. The Committee's statement emphasized it would "assess the appropriate path" and "act as appropriate to sustain the expansion," but the Summary of Economic Projections showed no median expectation for rate changes in 2020.

The 10-year Treasury yield averaged approximately 1.77% during Q4, representing a significant backup from the 1.46% intraday lows reached in early September. This bear steepening was driven by receding recession fears, improved manufacturing data, and progress toward a Phase 1 trade agreement with China announced December 13. The 2s10s curve re-steepened to around 20bps by year-end, a stark contrast to the August inversion that had generated considerable anxiety about economic outlook. For mortgage borrowers, the 30-year rate's stability in the mid-3.60% range—down more than 90bps from the prior year's highs—represented an extraordinarily favorable financing environment that would continue to support both purchase and refinance activity.

## MBS Technicals and Spread Performance

Agency MBS spreads delivered another leg of tightening in Q4, with option-adjusted spreads compressing to approximately 22bps—levels not seen since before the 2013 taper tantrum. This performance was particularly impressive given gross issuance of roughly $360B for the quarter, as the refi wave generated substantial production. The tightening was supported by several technical factors: the Fed's MBS portfolio continued its modest runoff trajectory (standing at ~$1.52T) while the central bank focused its balance sheet expansion on Treasury bills to address repo market pressures; money manager and bank demand remained robust in the low-rate environment; and overseas buyers maintained steady interest in Agency paper as positive-yielding, high-quality assets became increasingly scarce globally.

Current coupon production centered on the 3.0% and 3.5% coupons, with the 3.0% establishing itself as the primary production coupon for most of the quarter. TBA dollar prices in these coupons traded in the 102-104 range, and roll specialness remained generally well-behaved as the UMBS ecosystem matured. Specified pool pay-ups told a story of intense demand for prepayment protection: loan balance caps traded at approximately +3.0pts over TBA, while high quality geographic and servicer pools commanded significant premiums. Investors remained willing to pay up for convexity protection, correctly anticipating that the Fed's pause would keep rates range-bound and prepayment risk elevated through 2020.

## Housing Market Fundamentals

The housing market entered 2020 with considerable momentum, as Q4 data painted a picture of broad-based strength. Housing starts surged to approximately 1.38 million SAAR—the highest level since 2007—driven by both single-family and multifamily construction. Existing home sales held steady around 5.4 million SAAR, supported by low unemployment (3.5%), wage growth, and the dramatic improvement in affordability versus the prior year. The Case-Shiller national home price index posted year-over-year gains of approximately 3.5%, representing healthy but not overheated appreciation that balanced supply constraints with modest demand increases.

The FHFA's announcement of 2020 conforming loan limits provided additional tailwinds: the baseline limit would increase 5.4% to $510,400, the largest dollar increase in history and a reflection of strong cumulative home price appreciation since the post-crisis lows. This expansion of the conforming box would bring additional borrowers into the Agency universe and support purchase origination in high-cost markets. Credit quality metrics remained pristine, with 90+ day delinquencies hovering around 0.40%—the lowest levels in decades—as the combination of tight underwriting standards and strong home price appreciation left virtually all borrowers with substantial equity cushions.

## Origination and Refinance Activity

Mortgage origination volumes surged to approximately $430B in Q4, with the mix heavily tilted toward refinancing activity that represented roughly 66% of total production. The refi wave, which had begun accelerating in mid-2019 as rates dropped, maintained its intensity through year-end as borrowers who had financed or refinanced in 2017-2018 at rates in the 4.00-5.00% range found compelling economics to move into the mid-to-high 3.00% range. Purchase origination held steady around $145B, benefiting from improved affordability and the jobs market's continued strength, while refi volume reached approximately $285B for the quarter.

Primary-secondary spreads widened modestly as lenders struggled with capacity constraints and sought to moderate pull-through, but competition remained fierce and borrowers generally captured the majority of the rate rally. The MBA's refinance index remained elevated throughout Q4, and the pipeline entering 2020 suggested continued strong production in the first quarter. For investors, the implication was clear: prepayment speeds would remain elevated in seasoned, higher-coupon collateral, while newer production in 3.0% and 3.5% coupons would likely exhibit slower but still elevated speeds given the burnout-free nature of the cohorts and the potential for further rate rallies.

## GSE Performance and Policy Developments

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued to generate substantial profitability in Q4, with Fannie reporting approximately $3.2B in net income and Freddie posting roughly $2.5B. For full-year 2019, Fannie's net income reached approximately $14.2B, while Freddie contributed meaningfully to the Treasury's coffers through profit sweep payments under the Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. Both enterprises maintained strong capital ratios relative to their risk profiles, though both remained far below the levels that would be required under the FHFA's re-proposed capital rule that drew extensive comment throughout Q4.

The GSE capital rule, initially proposed and then re-proposed in September 2019, represented the most significant policy development for the enterprises. The comment period extending through Q4 generated intense debate around appropriate capital levels, treatment of credit risk transfer (CRT) instruments, and the competitive implications for the enterprises versus private capital. Speaking of CRT, full-year 2019 issuance reached approximately $12B across all structures, as the GSEs continued building out risk-sharing arrangements with private investors. The FHFA's emphasis on CRT as a path toward eventual capital compliance and the potential for administrative reform (absent legislative action) dominated strategic discussions as the year closed.

## Non-Agency and Private Label Developments

One of the most notable developments in Q4 2019 was the continued maturation of the non-QM mortgage market, which reached record issuance levels of approximately $25B+ for the full year. This represented more than a doubling from 2018 volumes and reflected several converging factors: investors' search for yield in a low-rate environment, increased comfort with underwriting and documentation standards in the sector, and a growing population of creditworthy borrowers (particularly self-employed and high-net-worth individuals) who fell outside traditional Agency boxes due to income documentation or debt-to-income considerations rather than credit quality concerns.

Non-QM securitization spreads tightened substantially throughout 2019, with senior tranches of high-quality issuance trading inside 150bps over swaps by year-end—levels that would have been unthinkable even two years prior. The investor base broadened beyond hedge funds and specialty finance players to include insurance companies, pension funds, and even some traditional Agency investors seeking incremental yield. Importantly, the non-QM market was NOT recreating the subprime excesses of 2005-2007: typical non-QM loans featured substantial down payments (often 20%+), full documentation of assets, and borrowers with strong credit profiles. The market was filling a legitimate gap in credit availability, and its growth represented a healthy sign of private capital returning to mortgage risk.

## Outlook and Strategic Considerations

As we entered 2020, the mortgage market outlook appeared constructive but increasingly range-bound. The Fed's clear signal that the easing cycle was complete—absent a material deterioration in economic conditions—suggested that mortgage rates would likely trade in a 3.50-4.00% range for the 30-year, bounded by the Fed's 1.50-1.75% policy rate and reasonable term premium expectations. This environment would continue to support elevated refinance activity, particularly if rates tested the lower end of the range, but the most dramatic refi opportunities had likely been captured by year-end 2019.

From a technical perspective, several factors warranted monitoring: the Fed's balance sheet operations and the trajectory of MBS runoff versus Treasury bill purchases; the potential for increased bank and money manager allocations to MBS given attractive relative value versus credit alternatives; and the GSE capital rule's implications for CRT issuance, guarantee fee pricing, and potentially retained portfolio management. The 2020 conforming limit increase would support purchase volumes in high-cost markets, while demographic factors (millennials moving into prime homebuying years) provided medium-term support for housing demand.

The primary risks centered on exogenous shocks: renewed trade tensions (though the Phase 1 deal reduced this probability), geopolitical developments, or an unexpected weakening in labor markets that could trigger another Fed easing cycle. Conversely, an inflation surprise or overheating economy could force the Fed to tighten sooner than markets anticipated, though this appeared a low-probability scenario given well-anchored inflation expectations. For MBS investors, the environment called for continued emphasis on prepayment protection through specified pools, tactical trading around supply waves and Fed operations, and opportunistic extension into higher coupons when volatility created value. The mortgage market closed 2019 on solid footing, with the UMBS transition complete, spreads near historic tights, and housing fundamentals supporting steady credit performance—a constructive setup for the year ahead.
