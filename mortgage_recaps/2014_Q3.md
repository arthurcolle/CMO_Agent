# Q3 2014 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

The third quarter of 2014 presented a fascinating paradox for mortgage markets: while the Federal Reserve methodically wound down its unprecedented QE3 program, rates continued to grind lower and MBS spreads remained remarkably well-behaved. The 30-year mortgage rate averaged approximately 4.12% for the quarter, with the 10-year Treasury rallying to around 2.50% despite the Fed tapering its MBS purchases down to just $10 billion per month by September. This environment reflected a perfect storm of technical and fundamental factors—heightened geopolitical tensions, a resurgent dollar, decelerating domestic growth fears, and the market's growing comfort with a post-QE reality. For MBS investors, Q3 represented a transition quarter where the training wheels were coming off, yet spreads held firm as private demand proved more than capable of absorbing supply in the $340 billion gross issuance environment.

## Rates and Monetary Policy: The Final Countdown

The dominant narrative for Q3 was the impending conclusion of QE3, with the Fed on track to cease new asset purchases entirely by October. At both the July and September FOMC meetings, the Committee maintained its disciplined $10 billion per meeting taper cadence, bringing monthly MBS purchases down to just $10 billion by quarter-end. The fed funds rate remained anchored at 0-0.25%, but the September dot plot became a focal point for market participants trying to gauge the timing of the eventual liftoff.

Despite—or perhaps because of—the QE taper, rates rallied significantly during the quarter. The 10-year Treasury spent much of the period oscillating around 2.50%, well below the 2.75-3.00% range many forecasters had predicted for year-end. The 2s10s curve steepened to roughly 200 basis points, reflecting expectations for eventual normalization but also signaling growth concerns that would justify the Fed's patient approach to raising rates.

The 30-year mortgage rate's descent to 4.12% represented a meaningful gift to borrowers and a challenge to investors who had positioned for higher rates. The 15-year rate at 3.24% made shorter-duration products increasingly attractive to borrowers with equity and stable employment. This rate environment—low but not low enough to trigger a massive refi wave—created a "goldilocks" scenario for MBS duration profiles.

## Geopolitical Winds and Safe Haven Flows

Q3 2014 was marked by significant geopolitical turmoil that contributed meaningfully to the Treasury rally and, by extension, supported mortgage rates. The Ukraine-Russia crisis escalated through the summer, with sanctions and counter-sanctions creating uncertainty about European growth and energy security. Meanwhile, the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria added Middle East instability to the mix.

The Scottish independence referendum in September, while ultimately unsuccessful, created additional volatility and reminded markets that political risk wasn't confined to emerging markets. These factors combined to drive persistent safe-haven flows into U.S. Treasuries, even as the Fed was withdrawing from the market. The irony wasn't lost on strategists: as the world's largest buyer stepped away, global instability ensured that demand from overseas accounts remained robust.

The dollar's strength—bolstered by divergent monetary policy expectations between the Fed and other major central banks—created an additional technical tailwind for Treasury and MBS markets. Foreign buyers, benefiting from favorable FX dynamics, remained steady accumulators of agency paper throughout the quarter.

## MBS Technical Picture: Preparing for Independence

The MBS basis remained impressively tight throughout Q3, a testament to the market's maturation and the depth of private demand. Current coupon production centered on the 3.5% and 4.0% coupons, providing investors with modestly positive carry in a low-rate environment. While some volatility emerged around month-end FOMC meetings, the overall trading pattern suggested that the private market was more than ready to absorb supply without Fed support.

Gross agency MBS issuance of approximately $340 billion was comfortably digested by a diverse buyer base including banks rebuilding capital ratios, international accounts, REITs, and traditional money managers. The fact that spreads held firm despite the approaching "QE cliff" represented a validation of the asset class's fundamental value proposition: high credit quality, positive carry, liquid secondary markets, and favorable regulatory treatment.

Specified pool pay-ups began to tick higher during the quarter as investors anticipated a post-QE environment where prepayment protection would command greater premiums. Low loan balance pools, high LTV cohorts, and geographic concentrations in low-prepayment states all saw modestly improved pay-ups. While not yet at pre-crisis levels, this development signaled a maturing market where granular analysis and relative value trading were reclaiming their importance.

The TBA market remained highly functional, with adequate dealer financing and healthy turnover. Implied financing rates were well-behaved, and the market demonstrated resilience even during periods of Treasury volatility. For strategists, the smooth technical functioning of the TBA market in the face of Fed withdrawal represented the quarter's most important validation.

## Housing Market: Deceleration but Not Deterioration

The housing recovery showed meaningful signs of deceleration during Q3, though from elevated levels that made the slowdown seem more concerning than it perhaps was. Case-Shiller year-over-year home price appreciation moderated to approximately 6.7%, down from double-digit rates seen in 2013. This deceleration reflected both the normalization of the post-crisis snapback and affordability constraints in key coastal markets.

Existing home sales ran at roughly 5.1 million SAAR, a respectable level but one that disappointed those expecting a more robust recovery. Housing starts of approximately 1.03 million SAAR remained well below historical norms, reflecting both labor constraints in the construction industry and builder caution about overbuilding. The shadow inventory had largely cleared, but organic household formation wasn't yet generating the purchase demand many had anticipated.

From a credit perspective, the news remained uniformly positive. Delinquencies of 90+ days had fallen to around 3.0%, down from crisis-era peaks above 10%. The combination of rising home prices, tight underwriting standards, and improving employment meant that mortgage credit quality was perhaps the best it had been in decades. For MBS investors, this translated into minimal credit concerns and the ability to focus purely on interest rate and prepayment risk.

## Origination and Refinancing Dynamics

Total mortgage origination for Q3 came in around $310 billion, split between approximately $170 billion in purchase lending and $140 billion in refinancing. The 45% refi share represented a significant decline from the refi boom years but was still elevated relative to long-term norms, reflecting the borrower base's ongoing optimization of their mortgage rates.

The origination mix had important implications for MBS prepayment profiles. The shift toward purchase money originations meant that newer vintage MBS would likely exhibit slower prepayment speeds than refi-heavy cohorts from 2012-2013. This extension risk was partially offset by the continued refinanceability of the borrower base—even at 4.12%, there remained a substantial cohort of borrowers with rates above 5% who could benefit from refinancing.

Interestingly, the 15-year mortgage product gained market share during the quarter, as borrowers with equity sought to lock in the 3.24% rate and build equity more quickly. This development reduced the effective duration of new originations and created interesting relative value opportunities between 15-year and 30-year MBS cohorts.

The GSEs continued their rehabilitation during Q3, with Fannie Mae reporting net income of approximately $3.9 billion and Freddie Mac posting $2.0 billion. Both entities remained in conservatorship, and the political pathway to GSE reform remained murky, but the profitability figures demonstrated that the enterprises were well-capitalized and functioning effectively. For MBS investors, GSE credit risk remained a non-issue, with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government standing behind the paper in all but name.

## CMBS and Non-Agency Markets: The Awakening

While agency MBS dominated mortgage market flows, Q3 2014 saw continued growth in CMBS issuance, with roughly $25 billion in new supply. The commercial real estate market was firing on multiple cylinders—improving occupancy rates, rising rents, and aggressive cap rate compression driven by yield-hungry investors. CMBS credit quality had improved meaningfully from crisis lows, though concerns about covenant quality and underwriting standards began to percolate.

The non-agency RESI market remained nascent, with minimal new issuance but improving liquidity in legacy securities. As home prices rose and credit quality improved, investors who had bought distressed subprime and Alt-A bonds during the crisis were harvesting substantial gains. However, regulatory uncertainty (particularly around risk retention and Qualified Mortgage rules) continued to limit new issuance outside the agency channel.

The relative performance of CMBS and legacy non-agency securities provided important color on investor risk appetite. The fact that demand for these higher-beta products remained strong even as rates declined suggested that the hunt for yield was alive and well, with potential implications for future agency MBS spread performance.

## Strategic Implications and Positioning

For investors entering Q4 2014, several strategic themes emerged from Q3's developments:

**Duration**: The rates rally made many portfolios uncomfortably long duration. However, with the Fed on hold and global growth concerns persisting, there was limited urgency to defensive positioning. The key question became not whether rates would rise, but when—and Q3's price action suggested "not yet."

**Convexity**: With rates low but refinancing activity moderate, convexity concerns were manageable. Investors could harvest carry in current coupon securities without excessive extension risk in a back-up or significant call risk in a rally. This balanced profile made MBS attractive on a risk-adjusted basis.

**Specified Pools**: The uptick in pay-ups suggested that granular analysis would become increasingly important in the post-QE world. Investors who could identify and monetize prepayment protection would likely outperform those treating all TBA-eligible collateral as homogeneous.

**Credit**: With agency MBS offering minimal credit risk and credit-sensitive products still expensive, the case for staying in the agency box remained compelling. However, nimble investors could find value in well-structured CMBS and improving legacy RMBS.

## Outlook: Navigating the Post-QE Frontier

As Q3 drew to a close, the mortgage market stood at an inflection point. The October conclusion of QE3 would mark the end of an era—the Fed would no longer be the marginal buyer of MBS, and price discovery would return to private markets. Yet Q3's experience suggested that this transition might prove smoother than feared.

Several factors supported a constructive outlook for Q4 and beyond. First, private demand had proven robust and diverse. Second, housing market fundamentals, while decelerating, remained sound. Third, credit quality was excellent, removing tail risk. Fourth, regulatory changes (Basel III, liquidity coverage ratio) advantaged high-quality liquid assets like agency MBS.

The primary risks centered on the timing and pace of Fed rate hikes. If the economy accelerated and forced the Fed's hand sooner than expected, a disruptive bear steepening could pressure MBS spreads. Conversely, if growth disappointed and rates ground even lower, convexity concerns could resurface.

For strategists, the message was clear: Q3 2014 had validated the mortgage market's resilience and maturity. As the Fed's training wheels came off, the asset class had proven it could ride on its own. The next chapter would be written by private investors, armed with improved analytics, diverse strategies, and a hard-won appreciation for MBS risk-return characteristics in a normalized market environment.

The QE era was ending, but for agency MBS, the future looked remarkably bright.
