## Rates & Yield Curve

After eight consecutive holds spanning fourteen months, the Fed finally pulled the trigger. The September 18 FOMC meeting delivered a 50bp cut to 4.75-5.00%—larger than the 25bp many expected, signaling the Committee's confidence that inflation was on a sustainable path back to 2% and its desire to get ahead of potential labor market softening. The July 31 meeting had set the table with dovish language acknowledging "some further progress" on inflation; September delivered.

The rate move started well before the cut. The 10-year Treasury, which had been as high as 4.50% in late June, declined steadily through July and August as softer employment data (July payrolls revised lower, unemployment ticking to 4.2%) joined continued disinflation to build an overwhelming case for easing. By the time the cut arrived, the 10yr had already fallen to 3.75% before settling at ~3.80% by quarter-end. The quarterly average of 3.95% was the lowest since Q1 2024 and some 50bps below Q2.

The yield curve finally un-inverted. The 2s10s spread moved from roughly -40bps at the start of July to +15bps by late September—the first sustained positive reading since mid-2022. This was a bull steepening driven by front-end rates falling faster than the long end, exactly the pattern you'd expect at the start of an easing cycle.

The 30-year mortgage rate responded dramatically: from 7.0%+ in early July to 6.08% by the last week of September, averaging 6.50% for the quarter. The 15-year fixed averaged 5.72%. Primary-secondary spreads compressed ~15bps as originator capacity utilization improved and competition for volume intensified.

MBS OAS tightened to approximately 35bps, driven by the combination of lower rate volatility, reduced convexity hedging needs, and strong demand from real money accounts repositioning for a cutting cycle. The basis outperformed Treasuries for the first time in several quarters.

## Agency MBS Market

Gross agency issuance surged to ~$240B, the highest quarterly print since early 2022, as the rate decline sparked a meaningful pickup in both purchase and refinance activity. Production shifted lower in the coupon stack: UMBS 5.5% and 6.0% became the primary production coupons, displacing 6.5% and 7.0% that had dominated during Q2's rate peak. This coupon migration created favorable supply/demand dynamics for the new production—fresh, clean pools with known collateral characteristics attracted CMO and specified pool buyers.

Outstanding agency MBS stock held around $8.85T. Fed holdings declined to approximately $2.23T as the $35B/month MBS QT cap continued, though actual runoff slightly undershot the cap as principal payments on the Fed's portfolio (dominated by 2020-2021 vintage low coupons) remained minimal.

Specified pool pay-ups showed the first signs of life since 2022. Low loan balance stories saw 2-4 tick pay-ups on 6.0% coupons as investors began pricing in the possibility—still remote—that a sustained move below 6% could eventually create refinanceable populations. New York and investor stories remained at essentially zero pay-up. Dollar rolls in 30yr 5.5% and 6.0% TBAs were mildly special through September as originator hedging competed with CMO takedown demand.

## GSE & Regulatory

Fannie Mae posted Q3 net income of ~$4.1B; Freddie Mac reported ~$2.6B. Both GSEs continued to generate strong returns on equity within conservatorship. Combined equity climbed toward $135B.

The election-year dynamic kept GSE reform off the active policy agenda, though both campaigns made housing affordability a prominent talking point. The FHFA confirmed that the 2025 conforming loan limit would increase to $806,500—an 5.2% bump reflecting continued price appreciation and the statutory formula tied to FHFA's HPI. This marked the ninth consecutive annual increase.

CRT issuance accelerated in Q3 with ~$4.5B issued, bringing YTD volume to ~$11.5B and tracking for a strong year. CRT M2 spreads tightened to DM+185-200bps, the tightest levels since early 2022, as credit fundamentals (ultra-low delinquencies, massive equity cushions) and improving rate outlook attracted crossover demand from investment-grade credit buyers.

## Origination & Primary Market

Total origination volume jumped to ~$420B, the highest quarterly figure since Q4 2022, split approximately $230B purchase / $190B refi. Refi share rose to ~34% per MBA data as rates breaking below 6.5% activated a marginal refinanceable universe—primarily borrowers who originated in H2 2023 and H1 2024 at 7%+. This wasn't a refi wave by any stretch; it was a refi ripple. But after two years of drought, even a ripple felt significant.

Cash-out refi remained robust at ~55% of refi volume. Non-QM origination hit an estimated ~$30B for Q3, with DSCR investor products particularly active as the rental yield math improved with declining rates. Private-label securitization volume reached ~$20B, continuing the recovery trajectory.

Credit quality showed no signs of deterioration: average FICO of ~750, LTV of ~77%, DTI of ~37%. The jumbo-conforming spread compressed to ~30bps as bank portfolio demand for jumbos improved with declining rates.

## Prepayment & Convexity

The rate rally finally put a pulse into prepayment speeds—barely. Aggregate 30yr CPR ticked up to 6.0-6.5%, with most of the acceleration in 2023-2024 vintage 7%+ coupons that were suddenly 50-100bps in the money. The 6.5% and 7.0% cohorts saw CPR in the 8-12% range, hardly blistering but a meaningful departure from the 5-6% we'd seen for two years.

The 2020-2021 vintage low coupons—2.5s, 3.0s, 3.5s—remained completely inert at 3.5-5.0 CPR. These borrowers have 300bps+ of rate incentive to never move, and nothing in the macro picture changes that calculus. Turnover-driven prepayments stayed suppressed by the lock-in effect.

The convexity picture improved markedly in Q3. As rates declined and volatility compressed, duration on current production shortened from ~6.2 years to ~5.4 years. The 50bp cut actually reduced negative convexity concerns—cutting into a well-telegraphed easing cycle is the best possible scenario for MBS convexity, as it reduces uncertainty and option value simultaneously.

## Housing & Credit

Existing home sales ticked up to 4.05M SAAR—still near generational lows but showing the first real sequential improvement in over a year as sub-6.5% rates at quarter-end began pulling fence-sitters into the market. New home sales improved to 680K SAAR. Inventory crept higher to 4.0 months of supply, the best reading since mid-2020 and a genuine (if incremental) improvement in market function.

Case-Shiller decelerated to +5.0% YoY. Prices remained elevated in absolute terms but the growth rate was normalizing as inventory slowly improved. Housing starts held at 1.35M SAAR with single-family showing resilience.

Delinquency rates edged up to 3.6% (30+ days) but from such low levels that this registered as normalization rather than concern. Serious delinquency (90+ days) remained well below 2%. FHA delinquency rates were slightly higher at ~8% as lower-income borrowers felt more affordability pressure, but loss severity was contained by strong equity positions.

## Non-Agency & Structured Products

CMBS issuance hit ~$28B in Q3 as declining rates improved refinancing prospects for performing CRE loans, though office distress continued with CMBS office delinquency rates above 8%. Non-agency RMBS issuance of ~$22B marked a cycle high. CLO issuance remained robust at ~$45B.

Agency CMO issuance jumped to ~$50B as the rate decline and coupon migration created fresh collateral for structuring. PAC and sequential structures dominated, with declining rate environment favoring companion and Z-bond creation for yield-hungry buyers.

## Key Events & Narrative

**The 50bp cut heard 'round the world.** The Fed went big on September 18, cutting 50bps instead of 25. The message was clear: the balance of risks had shifted from inflation to employment, and the Fed didn't want to be behind the curve. For mortgage markets, the cut was less about the immediate impact (rates had already priced in 50bps) and more about the signal—this cycle is beginning, and the path forward is lower.

**Yield curve normalization.** The 2s10s finally un-inverted after 26 months—the longest inversion in modern history. This is structurally positive for bank NIM and real money demand for MBS, as positively-sloped curves incentivize duration extension and carry trades that naturally support the basis.

**The first green shoots in housing.** Inventory improvements, rate-driven demand, and marginal refi activity all suggest the worst of the housing freeze may be behind us. But "less frozen" isn't "thawed"—we need sustained sub-6% mortgage rates to meaningfully unlock turnover and refinancing. That's a 2025 story.
