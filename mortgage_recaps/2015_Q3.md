# Q3 2015 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

The third quarter of 2015 delivered a dramatic departure from the Fed liftoff narrative that dominated the first half of the year, as escalating concerns about Chinese economic stability and global growth forced the FOMC to keep rates on hold at its closely-watched September meeting. The surprise decision to delay what markets had largely priced as the first rate hike since 2006 triggered significant volatility across rates markets, with Treasury yields whipsawing through August's equity market turmoil before settling lower. Agency MBS navigated the turbulence reasonably well, with modest spread widening to ~20bps OAS as duration extension concerns gave way to renewed Fed put expectations. The 30-year mortgage rate averaged 3.91% for the quarter, supporting solid origination volumes of approximately $400B split roughly 55/45 refi/purchase. With global central banks diverging and the Fed's normalization path now substantially murkier, we head into Q4 with a flatter curve, tighter financial conditions, and growing questions about when—not if—liftoff will finally arrive.

## Rates and Fed Policy: The Great September Pivot

The quarter began with markets pricing roughly 50% odds of a September liftoff, reflecting the FOMC's increasingly hawkish rhetoric through the spring. The July meeting delivered no surprises, maintaining the 0-0.25% target range while emphasizing data dependence and growing confidence in labor market progress. Ten-year Treasury yields held relatively stable around 2.30% through mid-July, with the 2s10s curve maintaining a ~145bp slope as front-end pricing reflected imminent normalization.

Then China happened. The August 11 yuan devaluation by the People's Bank of China sent shockwaves through global markets, triggering concerns about competitive currency devaluations, capital flight, and the true state of Chinese growth. What followed was among the most violent risk-off episodes since 2011, culminating in "Black Monday" on August 24 when the S&P 500 plunged 3.9% and the VIX spiked above 40. Ten-year yields plummeted to 2.00% intraday as flight-to-quality flows overwhelmed the reflation trade that had dominated H1.

The Fed's September 17 decision not to hike—despite Chair Yellen's clear signaling earlier in the year—represented a watershed moment. The accompanying statement cited "recent global economic and financial developments" as creating near-term downside risks, effectively acknowledging that external factors had trumped domestic labor market strength. Markets rallied on the dovish hold, with 10-year yields settling around 2.15% by quarter-end and December hike expectations collapsing. The 2s10s curve flattened modestly but remained near 145bps as the entire structure shifted lower. For MBS investors, the whipsaw raised uncomfortable questions about extension risk and Fed reinvestment policy durability as the normalization timeline stretched into 2016.

## Agency MBS: Weathering the Storm

Agency MBS spreads widened modestly through the quarter, with MBS OAS moving from the high-teens to approximately 20bps by late September—relatively contained given the magnitude of rates volatility. Current coupon 3.5s remained the production sweet spot, with approximately $370B in gross issuance flowing into a market already digesting $1.76T in Fed holdings. The Fed's continued reinvestment policy provided crucial technical support, soaking up paydowns and rolling prepays back into the market, though the September hold raised fresh questions about how long this backstop would persist.

Duration dynamics proved challenging. The rapid rally in August saw extension fears resurface as lower rates pushed borrowers out of the money on refinancing opportunities. Convexity hedging flows from servicers and REITs contributed to the Treasury selloff in late August, exacerbating curve flattening. However, the combination of still-elevated mortgage rates (relative to 2012-2013 lows) and tighter credit standards meant prepayment speeds remained well-behaved, averaging 10-12 CPR for seasoned 3.5s and 4.0s.

Specified pool pay-ups held firm, with low-loan-balance and high-FICO stories maintaining 30-40 tick premiums as investors sought convexity protection. The HARP refinance wave continued to fade—we're now well past peak HARP volumes—though HARP 3.5s still traded special given their burnout characteristics. With TRID (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure) implementation looming on October 3, servicers expressed growing concerns about processing bottlenecks potentially slowing refi activity, which paradoxically supported MBS valuations heading into Q4.

## Primary Mortgage Market: Balanced Origination

Total mortgage origination clocked in near $400B for Q3, a solid print reflecting the push-pull between rate volatility and robust housing fundamentals. The split tilted approximately 55% refinance ($215B) versus 45% purchase ($185B), as the dip in rates through August reignited marginal refi activity among borrowers who missed prior waves. However, this was no 2012-style tsunami—tighter credit boxes, higher credit scores (average FICO ~750), and greater borrower inertia kept volumes manageable.

Purchase origination remained the bright spot, supported by steady existing home sales running around 5.5M seasonally adjusted annual rate and continued home price appreciation of approximately 5.1% year-over-year per Case-Shiller. Housing starts accelerated to 1.15M SAAR, reflecting builder confidence and easing supply constraints in key metros. The millennial cohort finally showed signs of meaningful household formation, driving first-time buyer share modestly higher, though still well below historical norms.

Mortgage rates averaged 3.91% for 30-year fixed and 3.13% for 15-year fixed—attractive absolute levels but with enough intra-quarter volatility to create lock-desk chaos. The August swoon saw rate sheets reprice favorably, pulling forward some September demand, before rates stabilized in the 3.85-4.00% range post-FOMC. FHA and VA origination remained elevated at roughly 20% combined share, as jumbo lenders tightened overlays amid secondary market spread widening.

## GSE Performance and Credit Quality

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continued their post-conservatorship profit engine, reporting Q3 net income of approximately $3.0B and $2.0B, respectively. These results reflected benign credit performance, solid guarantee fee revenue, and investment portfolio yields still generating positive carry despite the flatter curve. Both GSEs swept their net worth minus capital reserves to Treasury under the senior preferred stock purchase agreements, adding to the $240B+ already returned since 2012—well exceeding the original $187B bailout.

Credit quality metrics remained exceptional. Serious delinquency rates (90+ days) fell to approximately 2.1%, down from mid-2000s peaks above 5% and approaching pre-crisis norms. New vintage performance—2013-2015 originations—showed pristine payment patterns, reflecting the combination of tight underwriting, strong home price appreciation, and substantial borrower equity cushions. Average LTV on new production hovered around 75-80% excluding MI, while FICO scores remained near record highs.

The GSEs' capital adequacy remained a political flashpoint. Their combined net worth approached $8B by quarter-end, but with no retained earnings buffer under the sweep structure, they remained one market shock away from requiring Treasury draws. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) continued to signal interest in reducing GSE footprint, including proposed reductions to conforming loan limits (ultimately not implemented), but concrete reform efforts remained stalled in Congress. For MBS investors, this status quo translated to continued implicit full faith and credit backing—a crucial assumption supporting tight spreads.

## Housing Market Fundamentals

Underlying housing fundamentals delivered a mixed but generally constructive picture. Existing home sales maintained a healthy ~5.5M SAAR pace, supported by low inventory (approximately 5 months supply), steady job growth (averaging 200K+ monthly payroll gains), and still-favorable affordability despite rising prices. The inventory constraint was real—new listings struggled to keep pace with demand, pushing list-to-sale timeframes shorter and fueling bidding wars in coastal and recovering Sun Belt markets.

Home price appreciation of 5.1% year-over-year per Case-Shiller represented a modest deceleration from 2013-2014's post-crisis surge, but remained well above income growth and inflation. This created affordability headwinds, particularly for first-time buyers lacking existing home equity. Markets like San Francisco, Seattle, Denver, and Portland saw double-digit gains, while energy-sensitive metros like Houston began showing weakness as oil prices continued their 2014-2015 collapse.

Housing starts at 1.15M SAAR reflected ongoing recovery but remained below the 1.5M level consistent with household formation and replacement demand. Builder caution reflected labor shortages, lot scarcity, and regulatory costs rather than demand weakness. Single-family starts outpaced multifamily for the first time in years, signaling a maturation of the rental boom and renewed appetite for ownership among creditworthy borrowers.

The shadow inventory overhang continued to dissipate. Foreclosure timelines shortened, REO-to-rental conversions absorbed distressed supply, and negative equity rates fell to approximately 10% of mortgaged homes (down from 25%+ at peak). Strategic default incentives vanished in most markets as equity positions turned positive, reducing GSE loss severities and validating benign credit assumptions embedded in MBS pricing.

## CMBS and Commercial Real Estate

CMBS issuance totaled approximately $28B for Q3, down sequentially from Q2's pace as spreads widened sharply through the China-driven volatility. AAA spreads pushed 20-30bps wider, with subordinate classes facing even more acute indigestion as CLO bid and dealer balance sheet capacity waned. The repricing reflected both technical factors (deleveraging, redemption flows) and growing concern about aggressive underwriting in the 2013-2015 vintage.

Commercial real estate fundamentals remained broadly healthy—cap rates stayed compressed, NOI growth continued across major property types, and transaction volumes held elevated. However, cracks emerged. Retail properties faced growing e-commerce headwinds, while energy-sensitive office markets like Houston saw vacancy rates tick higher. Multifamily, the darling of post-crisis CRE, began showing signs of oversupply in urban core markets where construction cranes had dominated the skyline for three years.

Regulatory scrutiny intensified. The OCC, Fed, and FDIC issued guidance on CMBS risk retention ahead of 2016 implementation, forcing issuers to consider B-piece buyer capacity and structural changes. Rating agencies faced pressure to tighten methodologies following criticism of deal structures that pushed leverage ratios to 2006-2007 levels. For mortgage investors considering capital structure opportunities, the CMBS reset offered potential value but required careful vintage selection and structural analysis.

## Market Technicals and Flows

Technical factors dominated MBS trading through Q3. The Fed's $1.76T portfolio provided massive price-insensitive bid, reinvesting approximately $20-25B monthly in paydowns. This support proved crucial during August's volatility, preventing MBS OAS from blowing out to 2013 taper tantrum levels. However, the prospect of eventual reinvestment cessation—pushed further into 2016 by the September hold—remained a lurking technical risk.

Bank demand stayed resilient despite Basel III LCR headwinds. Large banks continued to view agency MBS as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), supporting steady if unspectacular portfolio growth. Money managers and hedge funds reduced leverage through August's volatility, cutting repo books and flattening convexity hedges, but returned as buyers into September's stabilization. Foreign central bank accumulation slowed as reserve growth moderated globally.

Dealer positioning remained light—Volcker Rule constraints and capital charges limited proprietary inventory—which contributed to wider bid-offer spreads during the August turmoil. Primary dealer net MBS positions stayed near zero, forcing more price discovery onto the customer bid. This structural liquidity challenge, evident since 2013, became acute during stress periods and likely represents a permanent feature of post-crisis market structure.

REIT activity provided a marginal technical offset. Mortgage REITs gradually rebuilt portfolios following 2013's bloodbath, levering 6-8x and capturing 150-200bp net interest margins. Book value stability through Q3's volatility—a stark contrast to 2013—reflected better hedging and more conservative positioning. However, with the Fed path uncertain and curve flattening, REIT demand remained tactical rather than structural.

## Outlook: Fog of Uncertainty

We enter Q4 with substantially more uncertainty than we carried into Q3. The Fed's September hold, while defensible given global cross-currents, removed a key anchor for market expectations and emboldened doves concerned about inflation undershoots and asymmetric risks. December liftoff remains possible—Yellen signaled as much—but markets now price only 30-40% odds, with some participants pushing expectations into 2016.

For MBS investors, this creates a complex calculus. Longer lower-for-longer supports tight spreads and contained prepayment risk, but also extends duration and compounds convexity challenges when normalization eventually arrives. The Fed's reinvestment policy provides a crucial put, but its eventual removal—whether mid-2016 or later—will force MBS to compete on pure fundamentals against Treasuries and corporates. We estimate cessation could widen spreads 15-25bps depending on implementation.

Credit fundamentals remain benign, and we see little risk of material deterioration absent a recession. GSE guarantee fees provide substantial cushion—~50-60bps depending on LTV and credit score—while pristine underwriting and borrower equity support low default expectations. The real risks are technical: Fed withdrawal, regulatory impacts on bank demand, and structural liquidity constraints that amplify volatility.

Mortgage rates in the high 3s to low 4s should support $1.5-1.6T annual origination, split roughly 60/40 purchase/refi assuming no dramatic rate moves. This keeps gross issuance manageable while housing fundamentals gradually heal. TRID implementation in early October represents a near-term wildcard—early reports suggest processing delays—but we expect teething problems to resolve by year-end.

Our Q4 base case: 10-year yields range-bound 2.00-2.30%, MBS OAS 18-25bps, prepays stable-to-slower, and Fed liftoff pushed to December or Q1 2016. Risks skew dovish given global growth concerns, oil price weakness, and below-target inflation. For carry-oriented accounts, current coupon MBS at +20bps over duration-matched Treasuries offer reasonable risk-adjusted value, particularly versus corporates now rich following the September rally. We remain constructive on agency MBS heading into year-end, though vigilant for technical shocks as geopolitical and monetary policy uncertainty persist.
