# Q4 2020 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

The fourth quarter of 2020 delivered a dramatic shift in market psychology as vaccine breakthroughs catalyzed a violent reflation trade, yet paradoxically concluded with mortgage rates at historic lows and MBS spreads near all-time tights. The Fed's unwavering commitment to $40 billion monthly MBS purchases, combined with explosive origination volumes exceeding $1 trillion for the quarter, created a technical environment characterized by extreme scarcity, special dollar rolls across the coupon stack, and specified pool pay-ups approaching levels unseen since the pre-crisis era. While rates backed up 27bps from November lows following the Pfizer vaccine announcement, mortgage production remained at unprecedented levels with the 2.0% coupon firmly established as the current coupon—a historic development that fundamentally reshaped portfolio positioning and hedging dynamics across the street.

## Rates and Macro Backdrop

The quarter opened with the 10-year Treasury anchored near 0.70% and the 30-year mortgage rate hovering around 2.85%, but November 9th changed everything. Pfizer's vaccine efficacy announcement triggered an immediate 15bp bear steepening as long-end rates surged on reflation expectations while the front end remained pinned by the Fed's zero-rate commitment. By year-end, the 10-year settled at 0.93%, with the 2s10s curve steepening to approximately 80bps from the mid-60s range that prevailed in early Q4.

The presidential election on November 3rd created a brief period of uncertainty, but Biden's victory combined with initial expectations of a divided Congress (before Georgia runoff implications became clear) was largely absorbed without major rate volatility. The real driver was the vaccine-induced regime change: suddenly, 2021 growth and inflation expectations were being dramatically revised upward, and the curve pricing reflected newfound optimism about economic normalization.

Despite this backup, mortgage rates remarkably hit 2.65% by January 7th, barely a week after quarter-end, approaching the all-time lows recorded earlier in 2020. The 30-year rate averaged approximately 2.77% for Q4, with the 15-year at 2.30%—levels that continued to fuel extraordinary refinancing activity and supported robust home purchase demand amid a raging housing market.

## Fed Policy and Forward Guidance

The FOMC meetings in November and December reinforced the Fed's commitment to extraordinary accommodation, with the December meeting delivering enhanced forward guidance that purchases would continue until "substantial further progress" toward maximum employment and price stability goals. This outcome-based framework replaced vaguer prior language and signaled that the Fed's $120 billion monthly purchase program ($80B Treasuries, $40B MBS) would persist well into 2021 and potentially beyond.

Chair Powell repeatedly emphasized that the committee wasn't "even thinking about thinking about" rate hikes, while the dots plot showed rates pinned at zero through 2023. More relevant for MBS markets was the ongoing internal debate about purchase composition—some regional Fed presidents and staff argued for increasing the pace or shifting toward longer-duration securities to provide additional accommodation, though no changes were implemented in Q4.

The Fed's MBS holdings reached approximately $2.2 trillion by year-end, having grown by roughly $120 billion during the quarter. This relentless bid provided crucial technical support even as net supply surged, with the Fed absorbing a substantial portion of gross issuance and creating the scarcity dynamics that drove spreads to historic tights.

## MBS Technicals and Spread Performance

Agency MBS spreads compressed to extraordinary levels during Q4, with the current coupon OAS trading around 20bps by year-end—tighter than any point since the financial crisis and approaching levels that challenged fundamental value propositions relative to duration-matched Treasuries. The 2.0% coupon emerged as the clear current coupon, a historic development reflecting the sub-3% mortgage rate environment.

Gross issuance exceeded $500 billion for the quarter as origination volumes surged past $1 trillion, representing another record-breaking period. Refinancing activity accounted for approximately 65% of origination ($700B+) while purchase volume reached $300 billion amid the booming housing market. Yet despite this tsunami of supply, net issuance remained manageable given elevated prepayment speeds and the Fed's $120 billion quarterly purchase program.

Dollar rolls traded special across the entire coupon stack, with implied financing rates deeply negative for production coupons. The 2.0% and 2.5% coupons were particularly scarce, trading multiple ticks special as dealers scrambled to cover forward commitments amid the origination surge. This technical squeeze reflected the collision between massive production and limited dealer balance sheet capacity in the post-Volcker Rule environment.

Specified pool pay-ups reached peak levels unseen in over a decade. Low balance pools commanded 5-6 points over TBA in many cohorts, while other "stories"—low FICO, high LTV, investor properties, secondary homes—traded at historically rich levels. The pay-up structure reflected both prepayment protection value in a high-speed environment and the technical scarcity created by servicer retention behavior and Fed purchases skewed toward generic pools.

## Housing Market Dynamics

The housing market delivered an extraordinary performance in Q4 2020, characterized by surging prices, record-low inventory, and boom-level activity metrics. The Case-Shiller Home Price Index showed year-over-year appreciation accelerating to 8.4%, with momentum building throughout the quarter as the pandemic-induced migration to suburbs and secondary markets intensified.

Existing home sales ran at approximately 6.5 million SAAR, multi-year highs that reflected both strong demand and chronically tight supply. Housing starts reached 1.52 million SAAR as builders responded to favorable demographics, low rates, and work-from-home dynamics driving space preferences. Yet inventory collapsed to just 1.9 months of supply by year-end, a historic low that created intense bidding wars and supported continued price appreciation.

The mortgage market dynamics underpinning this housing boom were unprecedented: sub-3% 30-year rates, improved credit availability relative to the spring lockdown period, and strong labor market recovery for higher-income cohorts who dominate home purchase activity. Purchase origination of $300 billion represented healthy growth from prior-year levels, though refinancing remained the dominant driver of overall volume.

Forbearance levels declined to approximately 2.8 million loans (5% of outstanding), down from the spring peak but still elevated relative to pre-pandemic norms. The improving forbearance trend reflected both borrower exits as economic conditions normalized and the concentration of remaining forbearance among truly distressed borrowers. Credit performance remained exceptionally strong for new production given tight underwriting standards.

## GSE Developments and Policy

September and October brought watershed GSE developments as Treasury and FHFA amended the senior preferred stock agreements to end the net worth sweep and allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to retain capital. This marked a crucial step toward potential future conservatorship exit, though the incoming Biden administration's approach remained uncertain as Q4 concluded.

Fannie Mae reported approximately $5.2 billion in net income for Q4, bringing full-year 2020 earnings to $11.8 billion—a remarkable performance driven by massive volumes, benign credit, and reserve release dynamics. Freddie Mac posted $3.0 billion for the quarter. The GSEs' profitability and improving capital positions provided ammunition for reform advocates, though political will for comprehensive legislation remained elusive.

FHFA announced the 2021 conforming loan limit would increase to $548,250, up 7.4% from 2020—the largest increase since 2006 and reflecting the rapid home price appreciation. This expansion of the GSE footprint carried mixed implications: supporting affordability for high-cost markets while potentially crowding out private capital from jumbo lending.

The controversial adverse market refinance fee, originally scheduled for September then delayed to December 1st, was ultimately pushed again to February 2021 amid industry pushback. The 50bp upfront fee (subject to various exemptions) represented FHFA's attempt to recoup costs associated with COVID-related forbearance and reduced enterprise fee income.

Credit risk transfer markets showed signs of life after the spring shutdown, with approximately $5 billion in CRT issuance during Q4—well below the $20-30 billion quarterly run rates of 2018-2019 but representing meaningful reopening. Pricing remained wide and structures evolved to address investor concerns about tail risk and GSE commitment to the platform.

## Originator and Servicer Landscape

The origination industry operated at maximum capacity throughout Q4 2020, with total volume exceeding $1 trillion for the quarter and approaching $4 trillion for full-year 2020—shattering all prior records. Independent mortgage banks captured increasing market share from depository institutions, leveraging non-QM expertise, retail branch networks, and aggressive pricing to win business in the hyper-competitive refinance market.

Capacity constraints emerged as a binding factor despite the industry's rapid expansion. Turn times extended to 45-60 days for many lenders as appraisal bottlenecks, underwriting backlogs, and technology limitations constrained throughput. Originators invested heavily in digital mortgage platforms and automated underwriting tools to capture efficiency gains, though the speed of volume growth outpaced operational improvements.

Gain-on-sale margins remained extraordinarily elevated, with many originators reporting 200-300+ basis points as strong demand, limited competition in certain segments, and elevated secondary marketing values supported profitability. Warehouse capacity became constrained as lenders funded massive pipelines, creating opportunities for non-bank warehouse providers and driving some market share shifts.

The servicing landscape saw continued emphasis on forbearance management and loss mitigation, though the steady decline in forbearance rates allowed some normalization of operations. Servicing values remained depressed given elevated prepayment expectations, with many servicers viewing their portfolios as wasting assets in the low-rate environment. MSR sales activity picked up as banks harvested gains and reduced capital allocation to the asset class.

## Non-Agency and Private Credit

Non-QM and private-label mortgage markets showed meaningful signs of recovery during Q4 2020 after the spring shutdown, though volumes remained a fraction of pre-pandemic levels. Approximately $2-3 billion in non-QM securitization came to market as specialty originators restarted production and investors tentatively returned.

Spreads remained wide relative to 2019 levels, with AAA non-QM paper trading 200-300bps over swaps compared to pre-COVID levels in the 100-150bp range. Credit enhancement levels increased and structures evolved to provide additional investor protection, reflecting heightened risk awareness and the uncertain economic outlook despite improving conditions.

The jumbo market remained challenged as portfolio lenders dominated given unfavorable securitization economics. Banks willing to hold jumbo production on balance sheet could offer competitive rates, while securitization execution struggled to compete with GSE pricing for high-quality borrowers. Some observers noted the conforming limit increase to $548,250 would further pressure jumbo volumes in 2021.

Investor property and second-home lending showed renewed vigor as pandemic-era credit box tightening began to relax. These segments, often originated through non-QM channels or portfolio programs, benefited from strong collateral performance in vacation and secondary markets where pandemic migration patterns drove price appreciation.

## Outlook and Strategic Implications

As 2020 concluded, mortgage markets faced intriguing crosscurrents heading into 2021. The vaccine-driven reflation trade suggested higher rates ahead, potentially curtailing the refinance boom that drove unprecedented volumes. Yet mortgage rates remained near all-time lows, the Fed maintained its $40 billion monthly purchase commitment, and housing fundamentals looked extraordinarily strong.

The technical picture presented challenges: spreads at 20bps OAS offered little value cushion against potential supply shocks or Fed taper speculation, while specified pool pay-ups at 5-6 points made prepayment protection expensive. Duration positioning became crucial as convexity risk loomed with rates at historic lows and prepayment speeds elevated.

Portfolio managers debated whether Q4's spread tightening represented the blow-off top of a two-year rally or a new paradigm where Fed dominance and regulatory constraints on dealer balance sheets would permanently compress MBS spreads relative to historical norms. The bear case emphasized unsustainable valuations and inevitable Fed taper; the bull case highlighted structural scarcity and limited alternative spread products for duration-seeking investors.

For originators, the strategic question centered on capacity investment decisions: would 2021 volumes remain elevated or would rising rates crater refinance activity and strand expensive infrastructure? For servicers, MSR valuations at depressed levels presented potential opportunities if rates stabilized or backed up, though timing such investments amid elevated prepayment speeds remained challenging.

The Biden administration's housing finance policy approach remained uncertain, with GSE reform, affordable housing mandates, and regulatory priorities all subject to potential shifts. The Georgia Senate runoffs in early January would determine whether Democrats achieved unified government, carrying major implications for fiscal policy, inflation expectations, and ultimately mortgage rates.

In sum, Q4 2020 represented both the culmination of an extraordinary year and an inflection point as markets began pricing a post-pandemic future. The mortgage market entered 2021 with unprecedented Fed support, historic housing strength, and valuations that reflected extreme technical tightness—a combination that promised continued volatility and compelling trading opportunities ahead.
