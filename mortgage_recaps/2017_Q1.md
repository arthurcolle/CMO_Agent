# Q1 2017 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

The first quarter of 2017 proved to be a period of recalibration for the Agency MBS market as participants digested the implications of elevated rate levels, normalized prepayment speeds, and a Fed embarking on its second rate hike of the cycle. The Trump reflation trade that dominated Q4 2016 showed signs of fatigue during the quarter, particularly following the high-profile failure of the American Health Care Act in late March, which raised questions about the administration's ability to execute its pro-growth agenda. Despite these macro headwinds, the technical backdrop for MBS remained supportive, with the Fed continuing its reinvestment program, issuance volumes declining sharply from 2016's refi boom, and specified pool pay-ups recovering from their late-2016 collapse. The current coupon migrated higher to the 3.5%/4.0% stack, and while mortgage rates averaging ~4.20% dampened refinancing activity, the housing market continued to show resilience with home price appreciation running at nearly 6% year-over-year.

## Rate and Macro Environment

Q1 2017 opened with 10-year Treasury yields around 2.45%, elevated from the violent post-election selloff that pushed rates nearly 80bp higher in a matter of weeks. The quarter saw rates trade in a relatively narrow range, with the 10-year averaging ~2.44% and the 2s10s curve maintaining a ~115bp level of steepness. Thirty-year mortgage rates averaged approximately 4.20% during the period, down modestly from the 4.30%+ levels seen in December but still elevated relative to the sub-3.50% prints that characterized much of 2016. Fifteen-year rates averaged 3.44%, maintaining the typical 75-80bp differential to the 30-year product.

The Federal Reserve delivered a 25bp rate hike on March 15, lifting the fed funds target range to 0.75-1.00% in a move that was widely telegraphed and fully priced by markets. The accompanying dot plot remained unchanged at three hikes for 2017, though Chair Yellen's press conference struck a relatively dovish tone, emphasizing gradualism and data-dependency. Importantly, the FOMC provided no new details on balance sheet normalization, keeping markets in wait-and-see mode regarding the eventual fate of the Fed's $1.77 trillion MBS portfolio.

The "Trumpflation" narrative that dominated year-end positioning began to fade as Q1 progressed, with the spectacular failure of the Obamacare repeal effort (AHCA) on March 24 serving as a reality check on the administration's legislative capabilities. This raised doubts about the feasibility of tax reform and infrastructure spending, contributing to a modest rally in rates during late March that helped MBS performance.

## Issuance and Origination Dynamics

Agency MBS gross issuance totaled approximately $350 billion in Q1 2017, representing a sharp decline from the elevated levels witnessed in 2016 when rock-bottom rates fueled a massive refinancing wave. Total origination volumes came in around $310 billion, split roughly $140 billion purchase and $170 billion refi, yielding a refi share of approximately 55%. This marked a significant shift from 2016's refi-dominated environment and signaled the onset of refi burnout as the borrower pool with economic incentive to refinance at 4.20% rates had largely been exhausted.

The current coupon spent most of the quarter spanning the 3.5% and 4.0% coupons, a notable shift higher from the 3.0%/3.5% positioning that prevailed through much of 2016. This migration had important implications for prepayment speeds, pool valuations, and relative value across the coupon stack. Lower coupons benefited from extension protection as rates remained elevated, while higher coupons saw speeds moderate from the blistering CPRs witnessed during the refi boom.

The conforming loan limit increased to $424,100 for 2017, marking the first increase in a decade following years of post-crisis stagnation. This expansion at the margin increased the addressable market for Agency paper and reduced the flow of jumbo loans that would otherwise have fallen outside GSE purview.

## Technicals and Spread Performance

The technical environment for Agency MBS remained constructive throughout Q1 2017, supported by several favorable dynamics. Most importantly, the Fed continued its reinvestment policy, purchasing MBS paydowns to maintain its roughly $1.77 trillion holding. While the market remained focused on the eventual announcement of balance sheet normalization, the ongoing reinvestment provided steady bid support for the sector.

MBS option-adjusted spreads averaged approximately 20bp to the 10-year Treasury during the quarter, representing tight but not extreme levels relative to historical context. Nominal spreads were well-supported by the favorable supply/demand balance, as declining issuance volumes met steady demand from the Fed, banks rebuilding liquidity portfolios post-crisis, and money managers seeking yield pickup over Treasuries with limited credit risk.

The TBA basis (the difference between TBA and specified pool pricing) remained relatively stable, though the quarter witnessed a notable recovery in specified pool pay-ups from the Q4 2016 collapse. Low balance pay-ups, in particular, recovered approximately 1 point during Q1 as market makers rebuilt inventory and investors renewed focus on prepayment protection characteristics. The low loan balance cohort benefited from structural advantages including lower mobility, reduced refinancing sophistication, and servicing disincentives for small-dollar loans.

## Specified Pools and Prepayment Dynamics

The specified pool market experienced a meaningful recovery in Q1 2017 following the late-2016 dislocation when rapid rate moves and year-end position-squaring caused pay-ups to collapse across multiple cohorts. Low balance pools led the recovery with approximately 1 point of pay-up expansion, reflecting renewed investor appreciation for their defensive prepayment characteristics in an environment where refi activity was moderating but remained a concern for generic TBA holders.

Prepayment speeds moderated from 2016 peaks but remained elevated in lower coupons that retained refinancing incentive. The 3.0% and 3.5% cohorts continued to experience meaningful prepayments as the long tail of inefficient borrowers and delayed refinancers worked through the system. Higher coupons including 4.0% and above saw speeds decline more dramatically as the population with economic refinancing incentive shrank substantially at prevailing mortgage rates.

Geographic and issuer-based pay-ups remained compressed relative to historical norms, reflecting the market's focus on loan balance and buyout characteristics as the primary drivers of prepayment variability. New York and New Jersey pools maintained modest pay-ups based on prepayment lethargy, while California pools traded near parity given the state's historically higher mobility and refinancing propensity.

## Housing Market Fundamentals

The underlying housing market continued to demonstrate resilience during Q1 2017 despite elevated mortgage rates and affordability pressures in key coastal markets. The Case-Shiller national home price index showed year-over-year appreciation of approximately 5.8%, reflecting ongoing demand strength and limited inventory availability in most markets. Existing home sales ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of approximately 5.6 million units, healthy levels by historical standards though constrained by tight supply conditions.

Housing starts averaged approximately 1.24 million SAAR during the quarter, consistent with gradually recovering construction activity though still below the long-term average of 1.5 million units that prevailed pre-crisis. Single-family starts remained the constraining factor as builders faced ongoing challenges including lot availability, labor shortages, and regulatory costs that limited their ability to address entry-level demand.

Credit quality metrics remained pristine, with 90+ day delinquencies around 1.3%, near the lowest levels in decades and reflecting the combination of strong home price appreciation, robust employment conditions, and the post-crisis underwriting regime that emphasized fully-documented qualified mortgage production. The tight credit environment that prevailed since 2009 continued to limit credit box expansion despite regulatory attempts to encourage looser standards for qualified borrowers.

## GSE Financial Performance and Policy Developments

Fannie Mae reported Q1 2017 net income of approximately $2.8 billion, while Freddie Mac earned roughly $1.7 billion, both solid results that continued the post-crisis trend of sustained profitability following the dark days of 2008-2011. These earnings were remitted to Treasury under the net worth sweep that replaced the original 10% dividend structure, leaving both entities operating with minimal capital buffers and continuing to generate political controversy.

The GSE reform debate remained largely dormant during Q1 as the new administration focused on other priorities and key positions at FHFA and Treasury remained unfilled. The FHFA continued to advance the Common Securitization Platform (CSP) initiative designed to support the eventual implementation of the Uniform MBS (UMBS), which would create a fungible "to-be-announced" market between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities. This infrastructure development proceeded on a multi-year timeline with full implementation not expected until 2019.

Credit risk transfer activity remained robust, with both Fannie Mae (via CASŽ transactions) and Freddie Mac (via STACR issuance) bringing multiple deals to market during the quarter. The CRT market continued to deepen as investors gained comfort with the structures and the GSEs refined execution to achieve cost-effective capital relief. These transactions transferred mortgage credit risk to private capital markets, addressing regulatory mandates to reduce taxpayer exposure while providing institutional investors access to housing credit risk without the operational complexity of whole loan ownership.

## Outlook and Strategic Considerations

Looking ahead to Q2 2017 and beyond, several key themes warrant attention. First, the trajectory of Fed policy normalization—both rate hikes and eventual balance sheet runoff—will remain paramount for MBS investors. While the March hike was well-telegraphed, the market continues to price somewhat fewer than three hikes for the full year, setting up potential volatility if the Fed follows through on dot plot guidance or provides concrete details on MBS reinvestment cessation.

Second, the legislative agenda in Washington will drive macro risk sentiment and rate volatility. The AHCA failure demonstrated the challenges facing the administration's policy priorities, raising questions about tax reform timing and structure. Successful passage of meaningful fiscal stimulus could reignite the reflation trade and pressure rates higher, while continued legislative gridlock might support duration assets including MBS.

Third, the ongoing evolution from a refi-dominated to a purchase-dominated origination environment has important implications for coupon positioning, convexity exposure, and specified pool valuations. As the market adjusts to structural refi burnout at current rate levels, prepayment models require recalibration and investors must reassess prepayment protection strategies.

From a positioning standpoint, current coupon MBS in the 3.5%/4.0% range offer attractive carry and stable prepayment profiles at prevailing rate levels, with reasonable two-way convexity given the range-bound rate environment. Lower coupons provide extension protection in a bear scenario but carry risk of continued elevated prepayments as the refi tail works through. Specified pools merit renewed attention following Q4's reset, particularly low balance cohorts offering structural protection and reasonable entry points following pay-up recovery.

The Agency MBS sector enters Q2 2017 on solid footing, supported by favorable technicals, healthy housing fundamentals, and pristine credit quality, though investors must remain vigilant regarding policy uncertainty and the eventual transition away from Fed support that has characterized the post-crisis market structure.
