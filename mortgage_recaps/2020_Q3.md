# Q3 2020 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

The third quarter of 2020 delivered a once-in-a-generation mortgage market as record-low rates, unprecedented Fed accommodation, and a supercharged housing recovery combined to produce the most extraordinary origination quarter in history. The 30-year mortgage rate carved out new all-time lows at 2.86% in September, driving over $1.1 trillion in originations—the largest quarterly volume ever recorded. Chairman Powell's Jackson Hole announcement of Average Inflation Targeting (AIT) cemented expectations for extended accommodation, while the controversial FHFA adverse market refi fee injected late-quarter volatility into what was otherwise a relentless tightening environment. Agency MBS gross issuance exceeded $550 billion, overwhelming even the Fed's $120 billion quarterly purchase program and driving dramatic dislocations in specified pool pay-ups, dollar roll specialness, and hedge dynamics.

## Rate Environment and Fed Policy

Q3 belonged to the doves. The 30-year mortgage rate averaged approximately 2.89% for the quarter and touched 2.86% in September—firmly in record-low territory and nearly 100bp below year-ago levels. The 15-year rate compressed to roughly 2.40%, while the 10-year Treasury anchored around 66bp (range 55-72bp) with the Fed funds rate locked at 0-0.25%. The 2s10s curve steepened modestly to approximately 55bp as the front end remained pinned while longer tenors absorbed heavy supply and reflation positioning.

The marquee policy event arrived at Jackson Hole in late August, where Chairman Powell unveiled the Fed's new Average Inflation Targeting framework. The AIT regime—tolerating above-target inflation to compensate for prior shortfalls—represented the most significant policy shift since formal inflation targeting adoption. The market correctly interpreted this as "lower for longer on steroids," with the September FOMC dots confirming zero rates through 2023. This dovish recalibration turbocharged housing and mortgage demand while compressing vol and anchoring the front end even more firmly.

Fed MBS holdings expanded to roughly $2.1 trillion as the central bank maintained approximately $40 billion monthly purchases—down from crisis-peak levels but still representing substantial technical support. The transition from emergency-mode buying to steady-state accumulation proceeded smoothly, though the sheer volume of refi supply meant the Fed was absorbing a declining share of gross issuance even at these elevated purchase levels.

## MBS Performance and Technicals

> *The specified pool pay-up lifecycle reaches its zenith this quarter. From compressed pay-ups of 20-30 ticks in 2017-2018, to the refi-driven explosion to 3-4 points in Q3 2019, and now to the 4-5+ point peaks we're seeing in low balance stories — this is the most extreme pay-up environment since before the GFC. Enjoy it while it lasts. When the rate cycle inevitably reverses and prepayment risk disappears, these same stories will trade at zero pay-up (see 2022 Q3-Q4). The full lifecycle of specified pool value — creation, inflation, peak, collapse, dormancy, and eventual resurrection — will play out across the next five years of this series. We are at peak.*

Agency MBS delivered solid excess returns as spreads ground tighter throughout the quarter despite near-record supply. MBS OAS compressed to approximately 25bp—a remarkable tightening considering the $550+ billion gross issuance wave. Current coupon traded between 2.0% and 2.5%—historic lows that reflected the sub-3% mortgage rate environment. The combination of Fed buying, bank reinvestment demand, and money manager chasing yield in a zero-rate world overwhelmed even record supply.

The real action unfolded in specified pools and roll markets. Specified pool pay-ups exploded as investors desperately sought prepayment protection in a world where generic pools were burning at warp speed. Low balance pay-ups surged to +4-5 points in key coupons—levels that would have seemed fantastical just quarters earlier. High LTV, high FICO, investor properties, and geographic callouts all commanded robust premiums as the market priced prepay protection at never-before-seen levels. The pay-up structure became increasingly complex as originators and aggregators scrambled to capture value while servicers struggled with operational capacity constraints.

Dollar rolls traded exceptionally special on 2.0% and 2.5% coupons as failed trades and settlement squeezes became routine. The combination of record production, Fed take-out, and investor hoarding created persistent delivery pressure. Forward implied financing rates frequently traded through zero, effectively paying dealers to term out rolls. This specialness reflected not just supply/demand imbalances but also the operational chaos as the industry struggled to process record volumes while working remotely.

## Origination Market Dynamics

Q3 2020 shattered all origination records with over $1.1 trillion in production—the largest quarterly volume in mortgage market history and nearly double typical pre-COVID levels. Refinances dominated at roughly $750+ billion (66% share) as approximately 20+ million homeowners found themselves in-the-money. Purchase originations reached roughly $350 billion as housing activity staged a dramatic V-shaped recovery from spring lockdown lows.

The refi wave exhibited unprecedented efficiency as technology, competition, and streamlined appraisal processes compressed turn-times. Cash-out refis accelerated as borrowers tapped surging home equity—a notable shift from 2019's rate-and-term-dominant environment. The combination of record-low rates and double-digit annual home price appreciation created compelling cash-out economics across vintage years.

Capacity constraints plagued the industry despite massive hiring. Turn-times extended, locks backed up, and operational risk surged as lenders struggled to scale infrastructure fast enough. The remote work environment complicated matters—though it also enabled geographic hiring flexibility that eventually helped alleviate bottlenecks. Correspondent and wholesale channels gained share as retail struggled with capacity limitations.

Non-QM origination remained nascent as the sector slowly reopened following spring's near-total shutdown. Underwriting remained extremely conservative with significantly higher credit standards, expanded reserves requirements, and restricted property type eligibility. Volumes represented a fraction of pre-COVID levels, though green shoots emerged as investor appetite cautiously returned.

## Housing Market Developments

The housing market delivered one of the great turnarounds in modern economic history. Existing home sales surged to approximately 5.8 million SAAR—nearly back to pre-pandemic levels and up dramatically from spring's sub-4 million trough. Housing starts recovered to roughly 1.39 million SAAR as builders responded to surging demand. The Case-Shiller index accelerated to 5.8% year-over-year—up from mid-single-digits earlier in the year and gaining momentum.

The defining theme was inventory scarcity. Months supply plummeted to approximately 2.7 months—well below the 6-month balanced market threshold. Listings vanished within days, bidding wars became routine, and appraisal gaps widened as transactions struggled to keep pace with appreciation. The confluence of demographics (Millennials reaching prime household formation age), record affordability (monthly payments declining despite rising prices), and work-from-home migration created structural demand against constrained supply.

The WFH phenomenon triggered meaningful geographic shifts as workers unshackled from physical offices sought space, affordability, and lifestyle changes. Suburban and Sunbelt markets dramatically outperformed urban cores, with secondary markets posting double-digit annual appreciation. This migration pattern represented a potential regime change rather than temporary dislocation—with significant implications for long-term collateral performance, MSA concentrations, and geographic basis risk.

## Credit Performance and Forbearance

Credit performance stabilized dramatically from Q2's alarming deterioration. Forbearance peaked around 3.6 million loans (roughly 6.5% of outstanding mortgages) before beginning a gradual decline as many borrowers cured or began making payments while technically in forbearance. The combination of enhanced unemployment benefits (despite $600 weekly supplement expiration), fiscal stimulus, mortgage forbearance options, and employment recovery enabled many households to stabilize finances.

Early-delinquency indicators improved markedly from spring peaks, though considerable uncertainty remained about ultimate credit performance once forbearance programs expired. The GSEs and Ginnie servicers prepared for multiple exit options including payment deferrals, term extensions, and rate modifications. The industry recognized that forbearance represented a timing shift rather than credit loss mitigation—with potential losses merely delayed pending ultimate resolution.

Credit box expansion remained extremely limited despite robust housing and near-zero default rates on recent vintages. Lenders maintained elevated FICO requirements, conservative LTV constraints, and enhanced documentation standards. The memory of spring's chaos—when warehouse lines were pulled and secondary markets froze—kept underwriting conservative even as housing boomed.

## GSE Developments and Policy

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac delivered strong Q3 results with net income of approximately $4.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. Profitability reflected reserve releases, strong purchase volume economics, and stabilizing credit. The enterprises continued operating under conservatorship with Treasury backstops fully intact, though administrative reform efforts largely stalled amid election-year politics and pandemic priorities.

The quarter's defining GSE event arrived August 12th when FHFA announced a 50bp "adverse market refinance fee" on all GSE refi locks, citing COVID-related credit and operational risks. The announcement triggered immediate industry outrage over the rushed implementation timeline, lack of stakeholder consultation, and questionable economic justification. FHFA initially planned a September 1st effective date but subsequently delayed implementation to December (and eventually February 2021) following intense pressure from industry groups, Capitol Hill, and consumer advocates.

The adverse market fee controversy highlighted several fault lines: FHFA's mandate to balance access and safety-and-soundness, the GSEs' quasi-governmental status during crisis, and the broader housing finance reform stalemate. The fee's ultimate impact remained unclear pending implementation, though many expected originators would absorb much of the cost through margin compression rather than passing it directly to borrowers in an intensely competitive environment.

## Market Structure and Flows

Market structure evolution accelerated as record volumes stressed legacy systems and processes. TBA settlement increasingly struggled with delivery dynamics as specified pool pay-ups and operational constraints complicated allocation. Some large originators explored direct pool aggregation structures to capture pay-up value, while servicers faced difficult hedging decisions as retention assumptions broke down amid unprecedented speeds.

Bank demand for MBS remained solid as deposit inflows surged and loan growth lagged, forcing banks to invest in securities. Money managers maintained overweight positions despite tight spreads, recognizing that MBS offered compelling risk-adjusted returns relative to duration-equivalent Treasuries and corporates in a zero-rate world. Foreign demand stabilized after spring's disruption as hedging markets normalized and relative value improved.

The specified pool market's explosive growth created new dynamics and participants. Originators built sophisticated TBA/pool arbitrage desks to capture value, while aggregators proliferated to connect originators with investors. Pay-up discovery became increasingly electronic as platforms and pricing services raced to handle exploding complexity. The market recognized that specified pools were transitioning from niche product to core asset class.

## Outlook and Positioning

Looking toward Q4 and 2021, the mortgage market faces competing dynamics. Record-low rates and Fed accommodation support continued strong origination and tight MBS spreads, though the refi population is rapidly depleting—particularly among high-quality borrowers. Housing fundamentals remain robust with inventory scarcity and demographic demand, though affordability constraints loom as prices surge faster than incomes despite low rates.

The election introduces policy uncertainty around GSE reform, housing finance regulation, and fiscal support. Credit performance trajectory remains unclear pending forbearance resolutions and employment recovery sustainability. The adverse market fee's ultimate implementation and competitive dynamics warrant close monitoring.

From a positioning perspective, MBS screen attractive on swap-spread basis even at tight nominal OAS given Fed support, limited supply growth expectations (as refi wave depletes), and relative value versus credit alternatives. Specified pools remain essential for managing prepay risk, though pay-up levels require careful value assessment. Extended duration and higher-coupon legacy positions offer compelling convexity trades for those expecting eventual bear steepening or vol expansion.

Q3 2020 will be remembered as the quarter mortgage rates went where they'd never gone before—dragging the entire market into uncharted territory. The combination of unprecedented accommodation, record origination, and structural housing market shifts created opportunities and risks that will reverberate for years. The challenge ahead lies in navigating the transition from crisis-driven stimulus to whatever new normal emerges on the other side.
