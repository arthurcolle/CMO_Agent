# Q4 2015 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

The fourth quarter of 2015 will be remembered as the quarter liftoff finally arrived. After months of market speculation and FOMC hand-wringing, the Federal Reserve delivered its first rate hike in nearly a decade on December 16th, raising the target range for fed funds to 0.25-0.50%. The historic move capped a volatile quarter for mortgage markets characterized by regulatory disruption from TRID implementation, continued front-end flattening, and resilient MBS technicals that defied initial concerns about Fed normalization. While 30-year mortgage rates drifted higher from ~3.75% in early October to 4.01% by year-end, the move was orderly and spreads remained well-behaved. Agency MBS delivered modest positive returns for the quarter, outperforming duration-matched Treasuries as production coupons hovered in the 3.5%-4.0% sweet spot and convexity concerns remained muted. The backdrop of moderating but still-healthy housing activity, continued Fed reinvestments post-liftoff, and subdued prepayment speeds created a constructive environment even as the market transitioned into a new monetary policy regime.

## Rates and Fed Policy: Liftoff Has Landed

The defining event of Q4 2015—and arguably the entire year—was the FOMC's December 16th decision to raise the fed funds target range by 25bps to 0.25-0.50%, the first increase since June 2006. The move was heavily telegraphed following the October FOMC meeting, which set the stage with language changes that effectively pre-announced a December hike barring any major economic surprises. Markets priced the move with near certainty heading into December, and the actual announcement was anticlimactic.

The 10-year Treasury spent most of the quarter in a relatively tight 2.05-2.35% range, averaging ~2.19% and ending December at 2.27%. More notable was the continued flattening of the 2s10s curve, which compressed to ~125bps as front-end rates priced in the reality of a hiking cycle. Two-year yields rose nearly 30bps during the quarter, while 10-year yields were up only ~15bps—a classic late-cycle flattening dynamic that raised questions about the Fed's ability to normalize rates without inverting the curve.

Mortgage rates followed Treasuries higher but with a lag, reflecting seasonal origination patterns and spread tightening. The 30-year conforming rate averaged approximately 3.85% for the quarter, climbing from ~3.75% in October to 4.01% by December 31st. The 15-year rate averaged ~3.08%, maintaining its historical discount to the 30-year product. Crucially, the rate backup was gradual enough to avoid triggering a prepayment wave or significant borrower lockout effects heading into 2016.

## MBS Performance and Technicals: Spreads Stay Tight

Agency MBS navigated the liftoff quarter with aplomb, posting modest positive total returns and tightening modestly versus Treasuries despite the historic policy shift. MBS option-adjusted spreads compressed to approximately 22bps by year-end, near the tights of the post-crisis era, supported by still-formidable technical tailwinds.

The Fed's balance sheet held approximately $1.76 trillion in MBS as of December 31st, with the FOMC maintaining its reinvestment policy post-liftoff. This was a critical decision that alleviated market concerns about a potential technical cliff. The Fed continued to absorb gross issuance through reinvestments, providing steady bid support even as it began tightening the fed funds rate. The combination of Fed demand (~$20-25B monthly in reinvestments) and subdued gross issuance (~$340B for the quarter) kept supply-demand dynamics favorable.

Current coupon production remained firmly in the 3.5% and 4.0% stack throughout the quarter. These lower coupons exhibited minimal extension risk given the still-low absolute rate environment, and convexity hedging flows remained largely absent—a stark contrast to the taper tantrum dynamics of 2013. Specified pool pay-ups for low-loan-balance, high-FICO, and investor properties remained moderate, reflecting steady but unspectacular demand for granular prepayment protection.

Money managers and banks continued to represent the marginal bid for MBS, with regulatory capital requirements and Basel III liquidity rules supporting structural demand. International demand remained muted given negative rates in Europe and Japan, though some crossover interest emerged in higher-yielding 4.5% and 5.0% coupons.

## Housing and Origination: TRID Disruption, Resilient Fundamentals

Total mortgage originations for Q4 2015 approximated $350 billion, split between ~$145B in purchase originations and ~$205B in refinance activity. The refi share of ~58% reflected the still-low rate environment, though refi volumes were beginning to fade from earlier 2015 levels as rates drifted higher.

The quarter was dominated by implementation chaos surrounding TRID (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure), the new "Know Before You Owe" mortgage disclosure regime that went into effect October 3rd. The rule fundamentally changed closing disclosure timing requirements and created significant operational bottlenecks for lenders, many of whom dramatically slowed production in October and November to ensure compliance. Anecdotal reports suggested closings were delayed by 7-14 days on average, and some lenders temporarily stopped taking applications. The disruption was real but temporary—by December, most originators had worked through the worst of the transition, though elevated compliance costs and extended timelines remained industry headwinds.

Despite TRID headwinds, underlying housing fundamentals remained constructive. Existing home sales ran at approximately 5.2 million SAAR for the quarter, representing healthy year-over-year growth. Housing starts averaged ~1.13 million SAAR, continuing the gradual recovery in new construction. The Case-Shiller national home price index showed ~5.3% year-over-year appreciation, moderating from earlier in the year but still representing solid gains that supported credit quality and home equity accumulation.

Credit performance remained pristine. The 90+ day delinquency rate stood at approximately 1.9%, near post-crisis lows and far below historical norms. Tight underwriting standards, rising home prices, and a strengthening labor market created an exceptionally benign credit environment for both GSEs and private investors.

## GSE Developments: Profitability and Capital Relief

Fannie Mae reported Q4 2015 net income of approximately $1.0 billion, with full-year 2015 net income reaching ~$10.6 billion. Freddie Mac posted Q4 net income of roughly $0.6 billion. Both GSEs continued to remit profits to Treasury under the net worth sweep, which remained a source of controversy and litigation. The strong profitability reflected benign credit losses, solid guarantee fee income, and lower loss reserve requirements given the improving housing market.

A major GSE development was FHFA's announcement that the 2016 conforming loan limit would remain unchanged at $417,000 in most markets (with higher limits in designated high-cost areas). The decision reflected relatively flat home price appreciation in late 2015 on a year-over-year basis as measured by FHFA's methodology, disappointing industry participants who had hoped for an increase to support borrowers in expensive markets.

Credit risk transfer activity continued to accelerate, with full-year 2015 CRT issuance reaching approximately $10 billion across Fannie's CAS and Freddie's STACR programs. The GSEs used a combination of securities issuance and reinsurance agreements to transfer mortgage credit risk to private capital, reducing taxpayer exposure and building the framework for potential future GSE reform.

## Credit Markets: High Yield Wobbles, Mortgage Spreads Unfazed

While Agency MBS experienced a relatively calm quarter, broader credit markets endured significant stress in December. High-yield corporate credit sold off sharply amid collapsing oil prices and emerging market concerns, with the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund dramatically suspending redemptions and announcing liquidation on December 9th. The event sparked contagion fears and highlighted liquidity concerns in credit markets.

Notably, the credit volatility had minimal impact on Agency MBS spreads, underscoring the asset class's safe-haven qualities and government guarantee. The disconnect between deteriorating credit conditions and tightening MBS spreads illustrated the technical dominance of Fed flows and structural demand. Non-Agency RMBS and CMBS did experience modest widening in sympathy with broader credit markets, but moves were contained relative to high yield corporates.

The divergence served as a reminder of the GSE guarantee's value in risk-off environments and reinforced MBS positioning as a defensive spread sector heading into an uncertain 2016.

## Outlook and Positioning Implications

As we close the books on 2015, the mortgage market faces a fundamentally altered landscape. The Fed has begun its hiking cycle, ending seven years of zero-bound rates, yet MBS technicals remain supportive with continued reinvestments. The key question for 2016 is the pace and magnitude of further hikes—the December dot plot suggested four 25bp hikes in 2016, though market pricing reflected substantial skepticism.

For MBS investors, the outlook appears constructive in the near term. Spreads at 22bps are tight by historical standards but appear justified given Fed flows, low extension risk in current coupons, and solid credit fundamentals. The biggest risk is likely an unexpected acceleration in Fed tightening that forces rapid repricing of the front end and flattens (or inverts) the curve, though December's gradual "liftoff" approach suggests patience.

Specified pool premiums likely face headwinds as prepayment protection becomes less valuable in a rising rate environment, though the move should be gradual. We favor current coupon exposure in 3.5% and 4.0% coupons, which offer attractive carry with limited convexity risk at current rate levels.

On the origination side, TRID disruptions should fade as a factor in Q1 2016, normalizing production flows. However, rising rates will gradually erode refinance activity, shifting the origination mix toward purchase loans and reducing overall volumes. We estimate 2016 originations in the $1.5-1.6 trillion range, down from ~$1.75 trillion in 2015.

## Legislative and Regulatory Developments

Beyond TRID implementation, Q4 2015 saw relatively light regulatory activity. The FHA's January 2015 premium cut (from 1.35% to 0.85% for most borrowers) continued to drive market share gains for FHA loans throughout the year, with FHA volumes significantly outpacing earlier projections. This shift has implications for GSE volumes and highlights FHA's countercyclical role in supporting first-time homebuyers.

GSE reform remained stalled in Congress despite occasional rhetoric from policymakers. The conservatorship entered its eighth year with no clear path toward resolution, though the Johnson-Crapo effort had effectively died. Attention shifted to FHFA's administrative actions and continued build-out of the common securitization platform infrastructure.

Capital requirements for banks continued to tighten under Basel III implementation, with the supplementary leverage ratio constraining balance sheet capacity at the largest institutions. These constraints supported structural demand for Agency MBS (which receive favorable risk-weightings) while limiting banks' ability to warehouse whole loans.

## Conclusion: A Historic Quarter, A New Regime

Q4 2015 marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new regime. Liftoff—so long anticipated and so frequently delayed—finally arrived, yet the mortgage market absorbed the historic shift with remarkable composure. MBS spreads tightened, prepayments remained contained, and technicals stayed supportive despite the first fed funds hike in nearly a decade.

The quarter's relative calm was enabled by thoughtful Fed communication, continued reinvestment policy, and market positioning that had long anticipated the December move. As we enter 2016, the focus shifts from whether the Fed will hike to how fast and how far. For MBS investors, the carry opportunity remains attractive, technical support persists, and credit fundamentals are pristine—a constructive backdrop even as monetary policy normalizes.

The mortgage market has proven its resilience through taper, liftoff, and regulatory disruption. As 2016 unfolds, we expect continued spread compression in a Fed-supported technical environment, gradual rate backup that moderates refinance activity, and a slowly normalizing housing market that supports steady purchase origination. The new regime has arrived—and the mortgage market is ready.
