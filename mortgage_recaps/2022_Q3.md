# Q3 2022 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

Q3 2022 marked a brutal inflection point for mortgage markets as the Fed's hawkish pivot crystallized into concrete action, pushing the asset class through one of its most challenging quarters in decades. The combination of two consecutive 75bp rate hikes, the doubling of QT caps effective September 15th, and Powell's unambiguous "pain" rhetoric at Jackson Hole created a perfect storm that sent 30-year mortgage rates careening from near 5% in early August to above 6% by quarter-end. Agency MBS spreads widened to 55-60bps over duration-equivalent Treasuries, the 2s10s curve inverted to -40bps, and the housing market transitioned decisively into recession territory. Meanwhile, specified pool pay-ups evaporated entirely—an event we haven't seen since the financial crisis—as prepayment risk became a relic of a bygone era. The quarter's defining characteristic was volatility across every dimension: rates, spreads, home sales, and sentiment.

## Fed Policy & Rate Environment

The Federal Reserve maintained its aggressive normalization path with unwavering conviction throughout Q3. The July 27th FOMC delivered a second consecutive 75bp hike, taking the funds rate to 2.25-2.50%, followed by yet another 75bp move on September 21st to 3.00-3.25%. But the defining moment came on August 26th at Jackson Hole, where Powell delivered his terse 8-minute speech emphasizing that "restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time" and that this process "will bring some pain to households and businesses." Markets took the hint. The dovish pivot narrative died that day.

Ten-year Treasury yields averaged around 3.10% for the quarter but exhibited extraordinary volatility, touching 3.97% on September 27th as real yields surged and the curve inversion deepened. The 2s10s spread spent most of the quarter at -40bps or steeper—the most inverted since the early 2000s. Thirty-year mortgage rates averaged 5.51% but whipsawed violently: briefly dipping to 4.99% in early August before rocketing back to 6.11% by September's close as primary-secondary spreads widened alongside MBS OAS. Fifteen-year rates averaged 4.72%, maintaining roughly their historical spread relationship.

The rates volatility wasn't just a Treasury phenomenon. The UK gilt crisis that erupted on September 23rd following the Truss mini-budget and subsequent BOE emergency intervention sent shockwaves through global duration markets, amplifying volatility across all sovereign curves. Meanwhile, the dollar surged to DXY 114, adding another dimension of stress for international holders of agency MBS.

## MBS Technicals & Fed Balance Sheet Dynamics

> *QT is now fully operational. The Fed balance sheet ↔ MBS basis feedback loop we've tracked since 2014 Q1 — through QE3 taper, reinvestment period, QT1 (2017-2019), COVID QE, taper 2.0, and now QT2 — enters its most aggressive phase. From peak $40B/month purchases in 2021 to $35B/month runoff caps today, the $75B/month demand swing is the largest in the program's history.*

The technical picture for MBS deteriorated materially as Q3 progressed. The Fed's balance sheet held approximately $2.68T in agency MBS entering the quarter, and the September 15th doubling of QT caps to $35B/month represented a meaningful tightening of supply-demand dynamics. However, actual runoff has been constrained to roughly $18-20B monthly due to anemic prepayment speeds—a function of the enormous rate lock-in effect with the bulk of outstanding coupons sitting at 2.5%-3.5% while prevailing rates pushed above 6%.

Current coupon production shifted decisively to 5.0% and 5.5% coupons during the quarter, a radical transformation from the sub-3% coupons that dominated issuance just twelve months prior. Gross issuance totaled approximately $230B for the quarter, down significantly from recent years but still substantial in absolute terms. The lack of prepayments, however, means the net supply picture remains muted—existing pools are essentially frozen, exhibiting near-corporate bond behavior.

Agency MBS OAS widened to the 55-60bp range over duration-equivalent Treasuries, reaching levels not seen since the early pandemic months. Several factors contributed: reduced Fed absorption, higher rates volatility, worsening dealer balance sheet capacity in a rising rate environment, and generalized risk-off sentiment across credit markets. The combination of wider OAS and rising Treasury yields resulted in meaningful mark-to-market losses across the investment universe, with unrealized losses on bank MBS portfolios mounting to over $600B industry-wide—a foreshadowing of the SVB crisis that would materialize in Q1 2023.

## Specified Pools & Prepayment Dynamics

Perhaps the most striking development in Q3 was the complete evaporation of specified pool pay-ups. Zero. Nada. Prepayment protection has no value when prepayments don't exist. Voluntary prepayment speeds on seasoned pools dropped to the low single digits in CPR terms, and even burnout pools offered no premium over TBA. The entire infrastructure of specified pool trading—pay-ups for low loan balance, high FICO, low LTV, geographic concentrations, investor pools—became effectively dormant.

This represents a fundamental regime shift with profound implications for portfolio construction and relative value analysis. For nearly two decades, spec pool trading represented a significant portion of MBS market activity and a key source of alpha generation. The lock-in effect at current rate levels is so severe (with the median borrower sitting 200-300bps out of the money) that prepayment risk has been essentially extinguished. Extension risk, conversely, has become the dominant concern, though even that's mitigated by the simple fact that these loans will eventually pay down through amortization and turnover—just over much longer timeframes than historical models assumed.

From a portfolio management perspective, this argues for focusing on TBA liquidity rather than paying up for prepayment protection that has no marginal value. The spec pool market won't remain dormant forever—when rate cuts eventually materialize and refinance incentive returns, pay-ups will resurface—but that day is likely years away.

## GSE Financial Performance & Credit Risk Transfer

Fannie Mae reported Q3 net income of approximately $3.2B, while Freddie Mac posted $1.8B, both reflecting relatively benign credit conditions despite the deteriorating macro backdrop. Credit performance remained solid with serious delinquency rates near historic lows, though the forward outlook darkened considerably as housing recession dynamics took hold. Both GSEs increased loss reserves modestly, but not to levels that reflect a true stress scenario.

The credit risk transfer (CRT) market experienced notable spread widening and reduced issuance volumes during Q3 as investors demanded higher compensation for back-end risk amid rising recession probability. Subordinate CRT spreads widened 50-100bps across the capital structure, with mezzanine bonds moving from the high-200s to mid-300s. Issuance volumes contracted as the GSEs faced reduced economics on new deals and investors became more selective. The CRT market had been a success story of the post-crisis era, but Q3 revealed its vulnerability to rapid shifts in credit sentiment and technical conditions.

The broader credit outlook remains murky. While housing fundamentals entered the quarter from a position of strength—strong employment, limited supply, healthy borrower balance sheets—the pace of deterioration in home sales, price growth, and sentiment accelerated rapidly. The question isn't whether credit losses will rise, but by how much and when. Our base case assumes modest loss increases from current trough levels but nothing approaching financial crisis magnitudes given tighter underwriting standards and borrower quality.

## Housing Market Fundamentals

The housing market's deceleration became undeniable in Q3, transitioning from a mere slowdown to an outright recession. Existing home sales dropped to approximately 4.8M SAAR, down roughly 20% year-over-year, while housing starts declined to 1.44M SAAR. Inventory levels rose to 3.2 months—still historically low but climbing rapidly from the sub-2-month readings of early 2022. The Case-Shiller national index showed YoY appreciation still at 13%, but that backward-looking metric masked the rapid deceleration underway, with month-over-month readings turning negative in several markets for the first time since 2011.

The affordability shock drove the adjustment. Monthly payments on median homes effectively doubled from early 2021 to September 2022 as the combination of 40% price appreciation and a 300bp increase in mortgage rates compounded. First-time buyers were priced out en masse, while existing homeowners with low-rate mortgages hunkered down, creating a liquidity crisis in the market. Bidding wars evaporated, listings sat unsold, and sellers began reducing prices—modestly at first, but with increasing frequency.

Regional divergence became more pronounced. Sunbelt markets that had experienced the most extreme appreciation (Phoenix, Austin, Boise) showed the sharpest decelerations and outright price declines. Coastal markets with more structural supply constraints (San Francisco, Seattle) remained somewhat insulated, though sales volumes collapsed universally. The dynamics suggested a prolonged adjustment period ahead rather than a sharp crash—more 2006-2008 in pacing than 2008-2009 in severity.

## Origination Market & Industry Dynamics

Mortgage origination volumes contracted sharply to approximately $380B for the quarter, split roughly evenly between $190B in purchase originations and $190B in refinance volume. The refi share of roughly 31% would have been unthinkable in prior cycles at these rate levels, but the composition shifted dramatically toward cash-out refinances rather than rate-term refis. With nearly every borrower out of the money on a rate basis, the only refinance activity came from those extracting equity for consumption or debt consolidation.

The origination industry faced existential pressure. Margins compressed as volume evaporated, and the independent mortgage bank channel—which had grown to dominate origination during the refi boom years—faced severe distress. Mass layoffs accelerated throughout the quarter: First Guaranty, Homepoint Capital, and loanDepot announced thousands of job cuts collectively, with dozens of smaller shops closing entirely. The correspondent channel saw aggressive pricing competition as aggregators fought for limited volume. Warehouse lending standards tightened as banks reduced exposure to struggling IMBs.

The forward outlook for origination activity appears bleak through at least 2023. Purchase volume will remain constrained by affordability challenges and reduced mobility (homeowners locked into low rates are disincentivized to move). Refinance activity will remain minimal until rates decline substantially from current levels. Industry estimates suggest total origination for 2023 could drop below $1.5T—less than half 2021's peak of $4.4T and approaching 2008-2010 crisis levels. Consolidation and contraction will define the next phase of industry evolution.

## Outlook & Strategic Considerations

Looking ahead to Q4 and into 2023, the path forward appears characterized by continued uncertainty and likely further pain before stabilization emerges. The Fed has made clear that inflation control supersedes all other considerations, implying further rate hikes ahead (the dot plot from the September meeting suggested terminal rates approaching 4.50%). Mortgage rates in the 6-7% range appear likely to persist through much of 2023 absent an economic shock that forces the Fed to pivot.

From a portfolio positioning perspective, several themes merit attention. First, carry remains attractive in current coupon MBS despite wider spreads, particularly for investors who can hold through volatility. Second, the elimination of prepayment risk creates cleaner duration profiles, though extension risk requires careful monitoring. Third, relative value has shifted away from specified pools toward liquid TBA positions and potentially front-loaded structured products (PAC bonds, support tranches) where valuations have dislocated. Fourth, credit risk remains relatively benign but warrants increased monitoring as recession risks build.

The technical picture for spreads remains challenging near-term given ongoing QT and limited bank buying capacity, but valuations have reached levels that should attract international buyers, domestic pension funds, and eventually the regional banks once rate volatility subsides. The longer-term outlook for MBS remains constructive given structural demand from insurance companies and asset managers seeking IG duration exposure.

The housing market adjustment will likely prove extended but orderly absent broader economic crisis. Price declines of 10-20% from peak levels appear reasonable, which would return affordability toward historical norms without triggering systemic credit stress. The key wildcard remains the labor market—if unemployment rises significantly, credit losses would accelerate beyond current expectations.

In summary, Q3 2022 will be remembered as the quarter where the "higher for longer" narrative fully replaced any lingering dovish hopes, where the housing boom definitively ended, and where the mortgage market adapted to a radically different rate regime. The adjustment process is ongoing, painful, and far from complete. Welcome to the new normal—at least until the next crisis forces another regime shift.

> **A note on what's lurking in bank portfolios.** The $600B+ in unrealized MBS losses cited above deserves more than a passing mention. Regional banks — particularly those that extended duration aggressively during the pandemic QE window, buying 2.0-2.5% coupon MBS at par or slight premium — are now sitting on 15-20 point underwater positions with no prospect of recovery absent a massive rate reversal. These losses are "held-to-maturity" and thus invisible to income statements under GAAP, but they are brutally visible to anyone who marks the book at market. If deposit flight forces asset sales — and in a world of 3%+ short rates competing for savings that earn nothing at regional banks, that's not a hypothetical — the realized losses would vaporize capital ratios instantly. We are watching this dynamic closely. The feedback loop between Fed QT ↔ MBS basis ↔ bank unrealized losses ↔ deposit stability is the most dangerous transmission mechanism in the system right now. If it breaks, it won't be a spread event — it will be a solvency event. (See Q1 2023.)
