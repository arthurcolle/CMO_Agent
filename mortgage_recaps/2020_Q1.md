# Q1 2020 Mortgage Market Recap

**The Quarter Everything Broke: COVID-19, Emergency Fed, and the Great MBS Dislocation**

---

## Executive Summary

Q1 2020 will be remembered as one of the most volatile and dysfunctional quarters in agency MBS history since the 2008 financial crisis. What began as a constructive environment with rallying rates and a robust refi wave devolved into outright market breakdown by mid-March as COVID-19 transformed from a distant concern into a global pandemic that shut down the U.S. economy. The Fed executed two emergency rate cuts totaling 150bps, slashing the funds rate to zero, and launched unlimited quantitative easing including massive MBS purchases. Despite unprecedented Fed intervention, the MBS market experienced severe technical dislocations with TBA bid-ask spreads blowing out to 1+ point, dollar rolls going deeply negative, and OAS widening from ~22bps to over 100bps—the worst selloff since 2008. Primary-secondary spreads exploded even as Treasury yields collapsed, with the 10yr touching 0.54% intraday on March 9. The quarter ended with passage of the CARES Act introducing forbearance provisions that would reshape the mortgage servicing landscape. Origination volumes hit ~$580B driven by refi share exceeding 70%, while specified pool pay-ups collapsed to zero as dealers struggled simply to clear basic TBA trades.

## Rate and Spread Dynamics

The rate environment experienced extraordinary whipsaw action across Q1. The 30yr mortgage rate averaged ~3.45% for the quarter but the trajectory was anything but smooth. We entered January around 3.72% in a relatively stable environment, with the 10yr Treasury hovering in the 1.60-1.90% range. As COVID concerns escalated through February, rates began grinding lower, with the 30yr mortgage reaching the low 3.40s by month-end.

Then March arrived and all hell broke loose. The 10yr Treasury went into freefall, touching an intraday low of 0.54% on March 9—a level unthinkable just weeks prior and representing a crash of over 120bps from January levels. The quarterly average for 10yr yields was ~1.38%, but this masks the incredible volatility with daily moves of 20-30bps becoming routine. The 30yr mortgage rate ended March around 3.30%, down only 42bps despite the 10yr collapsing over 100bps from the quarter's start.

This divergence illustrates the key story of Q1: the catastrophic blowout in primary-secondary spread. While Treasury yields plummeted, mortgage rates failed to follow proportionally as the MBS market seized up. The spread between primary mortgage rates and MBS yields—typically 170-200bps—exploded to 250-300bps as originators simply couldn't handle the volume and capital markets desks were overwhelmed. Lenders raised rates *above* where the market suggested, pulled rate sheets multiple times daily, and some shops stopped quoting entirely.

The 15yr mortgage rate averaged ~2.93% for the quarter, maintaining its typical ~50bp discount to the 30yr but experiencing similar spread dynamics. The 2s10s curve compressed to around 30bps during the height of the March panic as safe-haven flows crushed the front end, though it began steepening again as the Fed pinned short rates at zero.

## Fed Policy: From Measured to Emergency to Unlimited

The Federal Reserve's response to Q1 events will be studied for decades. We began the quarter with the funds rate at 1.50-1.75%, a level the Fed had held since October 2019 after three "mid-cycle adjustment" cuts in 2019. The Powell Fed appeared content to remain on hold, monitoring trade developments and allowing policy to remain "data dependent."

COVID-19 forced a complete reversal. On March 3, the Fed executed its first emergency inter-meeting cut since 2008, slashing rates by 50bps to 1.00-1.25%. The move was intended to get ahead of the economic damage, but markets interpreted the emergency action as a signal of how serious the situation had become—risk assets sold off anyway.

Just twelve days later, on Sunday March 15, the Fed went nuclear. In an emergency weekend action, the FOMC cut rates by 100bps to 0-0.25%, returning to the zero lower bound for the first time since 2015. Alongside the rate cut, the Fed announced $700B in Treasury and MBS purchases—the return of large-scale asset purchases (QE).

But even this massive response proved insufficient to stabilize markets. As MBS market functioning deteriorated through the week of March 16-20, with dealers unable to finance massive inventories and TBA trades failing to settle, the Fed made its most dramatic move yet. On March 23, the Fed announced unlimited, open-ended QE with no specific dollar cap, committing to purchase "in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning." For agency MBS, this meant the Fed would buy whatever it took.

And buy they did. In the final two weeks of March, the Fed purchased over $300B in agency MBS—an unprecedented pace of roughly $15B per day. To put this in perspective, the Fed's total MBS holdings at the start of the quarter were approximately $1.5T. By quarter-end, this had surged substantially higher as the Fed became the overwhelming marginal buyer, essentially serving as dealer of last resort.

## MBS Market Dysfunction and Technical Breakdown

> *Every feedback loop identified in 2014 Q1 activated simultaneously this quarter: (1) Fed balance sheet ↔ MBS basis flipped from QT1-era contraction to unlimited emergency QE; (2) rates ↔ prepayments ↔ convexity ↔ rates reflexivity drove the 10yr to 0.54% as servicer hedging amplified the rally; (3) origination volume ↔ MBS supply ↔ basis ↔ Fed demand created a loop where record refi production overwhelmed dealers until the Fed absorbed everything. The specified pool market's collapse from multi-point pay-ups (see Q3 2019) to zero — the same kind of pay-up extinction we'll see again in Q1 2022 — demonstrates that these are liquidity instruments first and prepayment instruments second. When the plumbing breaks, everything trades at TBA.*

Beyond rates and Fed policy, the defining characteristic of Q1 2020 was outright MBS market breakdown. For mortgage traders and strategists who lived through 2008, March 2020 evoked uncomfortable memories—though the causes were entirely different.

The proximate cause was a massive supply-demand imbalance. Rates falling into the 3.30s triggered an avalanche of refinancing activity. Lenders locked in hundreds of billions of loans in a matter of weeks. These locks needed to be hedged via TBA sales, creating enormous selling pressure. Simultaneously, money managers faced massive redemptions and margin calls, forcing asset sales. Meanwhile, traditional MBS buyers—banks, insurance companies, pensions—stepped back in the face of market chaos and balance sheet constraints.

Dealer desks were overwhelmed. Primary dealer net positioning of MBS turned sharply negative as firms struggled to intermediate flows. Financing became scarce and expensive as repo markets seized up (necessitating Fed repo operations and eventually unlimited QE). The mechanics of the TBA market began breaking down.

TBA bid-ask spreads, normally 2-4 ticks (2/32nds to 4/32nds), blew out to 1+ point (32+ ticks). Dollar rolls—the implied financing rate embedded in TBA pricing—went deeply negative, meaning traders were paying to roll positions forward rather than earning a financing return. This signaled severe financing stress and dealer unwillingness to carry inventory. Fails-to-deliver spiked as trades couldn't settle properly.

MBS OAS widening was spectacular. We entered the quarter with current coupon spreads around 22bps over swaps—slightly tight by historical standards but not extreme. By mid-March, OAS had exploded to over 100bps, the widest since the 2008-2009 crisis. Even after Fed intervention stabilized markets, OAS remained elevated in the 60-80bp range by quarter-end. This represented a catastrophic mark-to-market loss for MBS holders, though the Fed's commitment to buy eventually put a floor under prices.

The current coupon migrated rapidly lower as rates fell, moving from 3.5% early in the quarter to 2.5% and 3.0% by quarter-end. Specified pool pay-ups—normally a robust market where investors pay premiums for pools with prepayment protection—collapsed to zero. In a functioning market, low-loan-balance pools, high-LTV pools, and investor pools typically trade 50bp to 1+ point above TBA. In March, nobody cared. Dealers wouldn't pay for specs because they couldn't even clear generic TBAs. The specified pool market essentially ceased to exist, with everything trading at or near TBA levels regardless of characteristics.

## Housing and Origination Market

The housing market entered Q1 on solid footing but ended in complete uncertainty. Pre-COVID data showed Case-Shiller home price appreciation running around 3.9% year-over-year, and existing home sales were tracking around 5.3 million seasonally-adjusted annual rate—healthy but not overheated. Credit quality remained strong with 90+ day delinquencies around 0.4%, near historic lows.

Then the pandemic hit. By late March, open houses were canceled, showings stopped, and large swaths of the economy shut down. The spring home-buying season was effectively canceled. The full impact wouldn't show up in Q1 data due to reporting lags, but the forward outlook turned from cautiously optimistic to deeply uncertain virtually overnight.

Mortgage origination, by contrast, was explosive. Total originations reached approximately $580B in Q1—a massive figure driven by the refi wave before COVID disrupted operations and spreads blew out. Refi share exceeded 70% as borrowers rushed to take advantage of sub-3.5% rates. This created the supply-demand imbalance that contributed to MBS market dysfunction, as hundreds of billions of loans needed to be hedged and sold into MBS.

Lenders faced operational chaos. First, they were overwhelmed by volume as applications surged. Then, as spreads blew out and capital markets broke, they had to sharply raise rates and slow production to avoid taking massive losses on pipeline hedging. Some smaller non-bank originators faced existential challenges as hedging costs exploded and funding lines were pulled. Only the Fed's intervention prevented what could have been mass failures in the origination channel.

The conforming loan limit for 2020 was set at $510,400, up from $484,350 in 2019, allowing slightly larger loans into agency programs—though this was overshadowed by the COVID crisis.

## GSE Performance and Policy Developments

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac entered Q1 in their twelfth year of conservatorship, still sending net worth sweeps to Treasury under the 2012 amendment to their senior preferred stock agreements. Both GSEs reported positive but reduced earnings for Q1 as they began building reserves for expected COVID-related credit losses.

Fannie Mae reported net income of approximately $0.5B for Q1, down substantially from prior quarters as the company increased loss reserves in anticipation of delinquencies and defaults stemming from pandemic-related unemployment. Freddie Mac similarly reported around $0.3B in net income with comparable reserve builds. Both GSEs emphasized that they had strong capital buffers and could handle expected losses, though the outlook was clouded by unprecedented uncertainty about forbearance take-up rates and ultimate default levels.

The big policy development came on March 27 with passage of the CARES Act, the $2 trillion pandemic relief package. From a mortgage perspective, the key provision was Section 4022, which mandated that borrowers with federally-backed mortgages (including all agency loans) were entitled to forbearance of up to 120 days upon request, with no requirement to document hardship. Servicers were required to grant forbearance to any borrower claiming COVID-related hardship.

This provision would have enormous implications for servicers, who remained obligated to advance principal and interest to MBS investors even when borrowers weren't paying. While the GSEs provided some liquidity facilities to help servicers manage advancing obligations, the forbearance mandate created significant cash flow and operational challenges, particularly for non-bank servicers without large balance sheets. By quarter-end, forbearance requests were just beginning to arrive, but the trickle would soon become a flood as unemployment skyrocketed.

## Market Events and the COVID-19 Timeline

The quarter's trajectory was entirely dictated by the COVID-19 pandemic's progression. January was relatively quiet, with coronavirus dismissed by most as a China-specific issue. February brought growing concern as the virus spread to Italy, South Korea, and Iran, but U.S. markets remained relatively sanguine.

March was the deluge. Italy locked down on March 9—the same day the S&P 500 hit a circuit breaker halt, down 7% within minutes of open, and the 10yr yield touched 0.54%. The WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11. President Trump declared a national emergency on March 13. Stock market circuit breakers were triggered three more times in March (March 9, 12, and 16)—unprecedented frequency.

By mid-March, state-by-state lockdowns began. New York, California, Illinois, and other major states issued stay-at-home orders, shuttering non-essential businesses and sending unemployment claims soaring. The weekly jobless claims report on March 26 showed 3.3 million new claims—shattering the previous record. The following week would bring 6.9 million claims.

For mortgage markets, the most critical dates were March 15 (emergency Fed cut to zero and QE announcement), March 23 (unlimited QE and massive MBS buying program), and March 27 (CARES Act passage with forbearance provisions). These interventions prevented complete market collapse, but couldn't erase the damage already done to MBS valuations and market functioning.

## Outlook and Strategic Implications

As we close the books on Q1 and look toward Q2, the outlook is characterized by extreme uncertainty tempered by massive policy support. The Fed has committed to unlimited support for rates and MBS markets, essentially putting a floor under valuations. With rates at zero and large-scale MBS purchases ongoing, technical conditions should gradually normalize from the March extremes.

However, fundamental challenges remain. The U.S. economy has entered a sharp recession, with unemployment set to spike to levels unseen since the Great Depression. Housing market activity has frozen. Forbearance take-up remains unknown but could affect 5-10% of all mortgages in a severe scenario. Credit losses will materialize, though agency MBS investors remain insulated by GSE guarantees—the credit risk sits with Fannie and Freddie (and ultimately taxpayers).

For MBS investors, Q1 represented catastrophic mark-to-market losses but also created opportunities. OAS levels of 60-80bps at quarter-end look attractive relative to the sub-20bp levels that prevailed in early Q1, particularly with explicit Fed support. Dollar rolls should normalize as Fed buying continues, though financing markets remain volatile. Specified pool pay-ups should gradually return as technical conditions improve, though likely not to prior peaks given the oversupply of premium paper from the refi wave.

Prepayment speeds will spike in Q2 as the massive refi wave locked in Q1 closes and pays off underlying MBS pools. We expect CPRs in the 40-60+ range for premium coupons, with current coupons also experiencing elevated speeds. This will pressure negatively-convex positions and could cause extension/convexity hedging flows if rates rise from current levels.

The mortgage market survived Q1 2020, but barely, and only with unprecedented Fed intervention. The quarter served as a brutal reminder that even the deepest, most liquid markets can break under sufficient stress, and that the Fed's role as backstop remains essential to mortgage market functioning. Welcome to the COVID era.
