# Q4 2022 Mortgage Market Recap

## Executive Summary

Q4 2022 will be remembered as the quarter mortgage rates breached 7% for the first time in two decades, Fed quantitative tightening accelerated, and the housing market effectively froze. The 30-year mortgage rate averaged ~6.67% for the quarter and peaked at 7.08% on November 10—the highest level since 2002—before rallying sharply into year-end as inflation data finally showed cracks. The Fed delivered another 75bp hike in November (the fourth consecutive jumbo increase) before stepping down to 50bp in December, bringing the terminal rate to 4.25-4.50% with a hawkish 5.1% dot plot for 2023. The message was unambiguous: higher for longer.

MBS markets endured violent two-way volatility. Option-adjusted spreads peaked near 65bp in mid-October before compressing to ~55bp by year-end as duration extension fears abated and a softer CPI print (7.7% vs 8.2% expected on October 13) ignited a violent Treasury rally. The 10-year traded from 4.25% on October 24 down to 3.48% in December—a move that provided temporary relief to mortgage holders but did little to revive origination activity. Gross agency issuance collapsed to ~$180B, the lowest in years, as refinancing activity all but disappeared (refi share fell to 28%, a historic low for rate-term refis). The lock-in effect—with 85%+ of outstanding mortgages carrying sub-5% coupons—paralyzed housing turnover and supply.

The quarter ended with the current coupon straddling 5.5% and 6.0%, the Fed's MBS portfolio at ~$2.62T and running off at ~$18B/month (well below the $35B cap), and a housing market fundamentally broken by affordability constraints. Fannie and Freddie posted combined Q4 net income of ~$1.8B amid rising credit provisions. Bank portfolios sat on $600B+ in unrealized losses. Originators shuttered operations. And the GSEs announced a sweeping overhaul of their LLPA fee matrices for 2023, further complicating the outlook. This was a market in transition—from pandemic-era exuberance to a harsh new reality of normalized (or above-normalized) rates and structurally impaired liquidity.

## Fed Policy and Rates: The Step-Down

The Federal Reserve remained in full inflation-fighting mode throughout Q4, delivering 125bp of tightening across two meetings. The November 2 FOMC brought the fourth consecutive 75bp increase, pushing the funds rate to 3.75-4.00%. By mid-quarter, market participants began handicapping a potential step-down in the pace of hikes, and the December 14 meeting delivered exactly that: a 50bp increase to 4.25-4.50%. But Chair Powell left no room for dovish interpretation. The updated Summary of Economic Projections showed a median dot plot terminal rate of 5.1% for 2023, with no cuts anticipated until 2024. The "higher for longer" mantra was reinforced at every turn.

Treasury markets whipsawed. The 10-year yield averaged ~3.87% for the quarter but hit 4.25% on October 24 before embarking on a dramatic rally into year-end. The catalyst was October's CPI release showing inflation at 7.7% versus expectations of 8.2%—the first meaningful evidence that the Fed's medicine was working. Rates plunged, and the 10-year closed December near 3.48%. The 2s10s curve remained deeply inverted at -75bp, signaling persistent recession fears and expectations for eventual policy reversal (though not imminently).

For mortgage rates, the move was even more extreme. The 30-year fixed hit 7.08% on November 10—a psychological and headline-grabbing level that hadn't been seen since 2002—before pulling back to average ~6.67% for the quarter. The 15-year tracked at ~5.93%. These levels represented a tripling from pandemic lows and obliterated affordability for most prospective buyers and borrowers. The effective cost of a mortgage had never risen so fast in modern history.

## MBS Technicals: Runoff, Convexity, and the Current Coupon

The Fed's MBS holdings stood at ~$2.62T as of December 31, down from ~$2.71T at the end of Q3. Quantitative tightening proceeded at a measured pace, with actual monthly runoff averaging ~$18B versus the $35B monthly cap. Prepayment speeds remained glacially slow—S-curves for recent vintages were effectively flat—providing natural amortization but little beyond that. The lack of gross supply from refi activity meant the Fed was absorbing a significant share of net issuance even in passive runoff mode.

MBS spreads were volatile but ultimately tightened through the quarter. OAS peaked near 65bp in mid-October as convexity fears reached a crescendo. Every backup in rates brought hand-wringing about extension risk, duration hedging, and the potential for a disorderly unwind in mortgage portfolios (particularly among banks sitting on hundreds of billions in unrealized losses). But the sharp rally in Treasuries into year-end flipped the narrative. By December, spreads had compressed to ~55bp as extension fears moderated and real money accounts tentatively re-engaged.

The current coupon migrated steadily higher, ending the quarter in the 5.5%-6.0% range. This represented a dramatic shift from the 2.0%-2.5% coupons that dominated issuance in 2020-2021. Specified pool pay-ups for loan balance, geography, and seasoning remained depressed as the entire market grappled with how to price convexity in a rising rate regime. CMO issuance effectively evaporated—dealer balance sheets were constrained, investor demand dried up, and the bid-ask on structuring costs blew out. The structured products market, once a vital source of spread tightening and liquidity, was in hibernation.

## Issuance and Origination: A Market on Life Support

Gross agency MBS issuance totaled approximately $180B in Q4, the lowest quarterly figure in years and a far cry from the $500B+ quarterly prints of 2020-2021. Total origination volume for the quarter was roughly $300B, split ~$130B purchase and ~$170B refi. Critically, the refi bucket was almost entirely cash-out or streamline transactions; traditional rate-term refinancing had vanished. The refi share of origination fell to 28%, a historic low and a stark illustration of the lock-in effect.

With 85%+ of the outstanding mortgage stock carrying coupons below 5%, borrowers had zero incentive to refinance into 6.5%-7.0% rates. Turnover-driven supply—i.e., existing home sales—collapsed as homeowners chose to stay put rather than trade a 3% mortgage for a 7% one. Existing home sales fell to ~4.0 million SAAR, down sharply from prior quarters, and housing starts moderated to ~1.37M SAAR. Inventory ticked up to 3.3 months, but much of this represented new construction or distressed listings; the organic resale market was frozen.

Originator economics were punishing. Gain-on-sale margins evaporated, application volumes plummeted, and layoffs swept the industry. Major IMBs and correspondent lenders shuttered operations or slashed headcount. The few remainingrefis were often driven by borrowers extracting equity to consolidate debt or finance large expenses—hardly the bread-and-butter refi wave that sustains the industry. For sell-side desks, this meant thinner flow, wider bid-asks, and an overall grind in market liquidity.

## Housing Market: Lock-In and the Affordability Crisis

The housing market entered Q4 in freefall and never recovered. The combination of 7% mortgage rates and elevated home prices (Case-Shiller YoY growth still running ~8%, albeit decelerating rapidly with month-over-month declines accelerating) created the worst affordability environment in decades. A median-priced home with a 30-year fixed mortgage now required roughly double the monthly payment compared to early 2021. First-time buyers were priced out entirely, and move-up buyers faced the double whammy of higher rates and the opportunity cost of abandoning sub-3% mortgages.

The "lock-in effect" became the dominant narrative. With the vast majority of homeowners sitting on sub-5% mortgages (and a huge cohort below 3%), selling and trading up was financially irrational. This paralysis starved the market of inventory, depressed transaction volumes, and created a bizarre equilibrium: prices weren't crashing (yet) because supply was so constrained, but demand was evaporating because affordability was so poor. Existing home sales volumes were off a cliff, and days-on-market ticked higher for the listings that did emerge.

Forward-looking indicators were bleak. Mortgage applications for purchase remained depressed, builder sentiment soured (though homebuilders offered incentives and rate buydowns to move inventory), and the consensus forecast called for further home price declines in 2023. The FHFA's announcement of a 12.2% increase in the 2023 conforming loan limit to $726,200 was a rearview-mirror adjustment reflecting 2022's price gains, but it did little to help borrowers facing the new rate reality.

## GSE and Agency Developments

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported combined Q4 net income of approximately $1.8B (Fannie ~$1.0B, Freddie ~$0.8B), a sharp decline from prior periods driven by increased loss provisions and mark-to-market adjustments on their retained portfolios. Full-year 2022 net income for Fannie was ~$12.9B, a solid result but reflecting a year of whipsaw volatility. Credit performance remained benign—delinquencies stayed near historic lows—but both GSEs built reserves in anticipation of economic deterioration in 2023.

The bigger story was the overhaul of the GSEs' loan-level price adjustment (LLPA) fee matrices, announced late in the quarter and set to take effect in 2023. The new fee structure eliminated or reduced certain penalties for lower-credit-score borrowers while increasing fees for higher-balance and cash-out refinance loans. The changes were politically controversial and operationally complex, adding another layer of uncertainty for originators and borrowers heading into the new year.

Credit risk transfer (CRT) issuance for full-year 2022 totaled roughly $8B, down from 2021 levels as the GSEs managed capital in a volatile environment. CRT spreads widened materially through the year, reflecting both general risk-off sentiment and specific concerns about housing fundamentals. Investor appetite for subordinate mortgage risk cooled considerably, and new issue concessions were required to clear deals.

The GSEs continued to manage their portfolios conservatively, mindful of FHFA mandates and the political sensitivity of their quasi-governmental status. With Congress gridlocked on GSE reform and the conservatorship entering its 15th year, the status quo persisted—but Q4's market turmoil underscored the systemic importance and fragility of the agency MBS ecosystem.

## Bank Portfolios and Systemic Risk

One of the most underappreciated developments of Q4 was the scale of unrealized losses sitting on bank balance sheets. With mortgage rates and Treasury yields up 300-400bp from their 2021 lows, the mark-to-market value of held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios had cratered. Aggregate unrealized losses across the banking system exceeded $600B, concentrated in long-duration assets like agency MBS and Treasuries. While these losses didn't trigger immediate capital charges under HTM accounting, they represented a latent risk—particularly for smaller regional banks with concentrated real estate exposure.

Banks' appetite for new MBS purchases was virtually nil. Deposit betas were rising as the Fed tightened, net interest margins were under pressure, and risk committees were in no mood to add duration or convexity risk. The traditional "buy and hold" bid from the banking sector—a critical source of MBS demand in normal times—was absent. This vacuum, combined with the Fed's ongoing QT and anemic foreign demand, left money managers and levered accounts as the marginal price-setters.

The crypto blowup of FTX on November 11 added to the general sense of financial fragility, even though direct linkages to mortgage markets were minimal. The collapse rattled confidence in risk assets broadly and reinforced the "risk-off" tone that pervaded Q4. It was a reminder that leverage, opacity, and complacency can unravel quickly—themes that were equally relevant in structured finance.

## Outlook and Positioning

As we closed the books on 2022, the setup for 2023 was deeply uncertain. The bull case rested on the idea that inflation had peaked, the Fed would pivot sooner than expected, and a recession would be shallow—allowing rates to rally and MBS spreads to tighten further. The bear case saw sticky inflation, a hawkish Fed, a hard landing, and a housing correction that would pressure credit performance and GSE capital.

Our base case leaned cautious. We expected the Fed to hike to 5.00-5.25% in early 2023 and hold there for an extended period. Mortgage rates would likely remain in the 6.0-6.5% range barring a sharp Treasury rally, keeping refinancing activity suppressed and the lock-in effect intact. Gross issuance would remain anemic, and MBS spreads would likely range-trade in the 50-65bp OAS band, with periodic volatility around FOMC meetings, payrolls, and CPI prints.

Housing fundamentals would weaken: we anticipated modest home price declines (low-to-mid single digits nationally, with regional variation), continued low turnover, and persistent affordability challenges. Credit performance would likely remain stable in the near term given the strong borrower profile of recent vintages, but tail risks were rising.

From a positioning standpoint, we favored liquid current coupons (5.5s and 6.0s) over seasoned premium bonds, given the uncertainty around prepayment behavior and extension risk. Specified pools offered little value given depressed pay-ups. CMO exposure remained tactical at best, given the lack of dealer support and secondary liquidity. For accounts with capital and patience, single-family rental (SFR) and non-QM whole loans offered alternative spread and structure, though at the cost of liquidity and complexity.

The bottom line: Q4 2022 marked the end of the pandemic-era mortgage market and the beginning of a new, lower-volume, higher-rate regime. Volatility, uncertainty, and technical dislocations would define the landscape for quarters to come. Navigating this environment required discipline, humility, and a willingness to abandon the muscle memory of 2020-2021. The easy money was gone. What remained was blocking and tackling in a market that had forgotten how to function without Fed support and zero rates.
