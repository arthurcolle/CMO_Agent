## Rates & Yield Curve

Q1 2025 opened under a cloud of uncertainty as the new administration's policy agenda began taking shape—and it wasn't the deregulatory nirvana some had hoped for. The January 29 FOMC delivered a hold at 4.25-4.50%, citing "uncertainty regarding the economic outlook" in an obvious nod to tariff policy. The March 19 FOMC was also a hold, with the dot plot projecting just two cuts for 2025, consistent with December's guidance but with wider dispersion reflecting genuine disagreement about the inflation impact of tariffs.

The 10-year Treasury traded in a volatile 4.10-4.60% range, averaging 4.35% for the quarter. The dominant driver was tariff policy whiplash: the administration announced broad-based tariffs on Chinese goods (additional 10% on top of existing duties) in January, threatened auto tariffs in February, then announced a global "reciprocal tariff" framework in late March that sent ripples through global risk assets. Each announcement pushed yields modestly higher on inflation expectations before pulling back on growth concerns—a tug-of-war between inflation premium and recession discount that left the 10yr essentially unchanged for the quarter.

The 30-year mortgage rate averaged 6.65%, modestly below Q4 2024's 6.72% but frustratingly stuck in the mid-6s despite 100bps of cumulative Fed cuts since September 2024. The 2s10s spread held positive at ~30bps, though the curve flattened periodically on flight-to-quality flows during tariff escalation episodes. MBS OAS widened to approximately 45bps as uncertainty drove elevated rate vol and reduced risk appetite for spread product.

## Agency MBS Market

Gross agency issuance of ~$200B was consistent with recent quarters. Production remained in UMBS 6.0% and 6.5% coupons. Outstanding stock held at ~$8.8T. TBA liquidity was adequate but bid/offer spreads widened modestly on days of elevated policy uncertainty—a new normal for a market learning to trade around tweet-driven volatility.

Fed MBS holdings continued their passive decline to approximately $2.09T, with the $35B/month cap still in place. At the January meeting, several FOMC members questioned whether the pace of MBS runoff remained appropriate given market conditions, but no changes were made. The market consensus firmed that the terminal level for Fed MBS holdings would be approximately $1.5-1.7T, implying another 12-18 months of QT at the current pace.

Specified pool pay-ups remained at or near zero. Dollar rolls were generally unremarkable, with mild specialness in 30yr 6.0% TBAs during March's risk-off episodes.

The big story on the agency side was the leaked proposal for a $200B GSE MBS purchase directive—a White House initiative to have Fannie and Freddie purchase agency MBS for their retained portfolios to "support housing affordability." Details were scant, but the mere concept sent shockwaves through the agency MBS market. If implemented at scale, this would represent a new source of demand potentially comparable to the early stages of Fed QE. MBS tightened 3-5bps on the headline before giving back gains as market participants questioned legality, FHFA independence, and implementation timeline.

## GSE & Regulatory

The GSE privatization debate heated up dramatically in Q1. The new FHFA director, appointed in February, made public comments about "establishing a pathway to responsible release from conservatorship" within the current presidential term. Treasury Secretary comments reinforced the theme, framing GSE privatization as consistent with both housing affordability goals and reducing taxpayer risk.

The market reaction was complex. GSE preferred shares surged 30-40% on privatization hopes, while agency MBS spreads widened 3-5bps on uncertainty about the implicit government guarantee under a privatized structure. The fundamental question: does privatization strengthen or weaken the agency MBS guarantee? The answer depends entirely on the structure—full faith and credit explicit wrap vs. contingent guarantee vs. pure private capital—and no details had been articulated. What we know: any credible privatization requires ~$150-200B of additional capital, implying either retained earnings (10+ years at current pace), secondary offerings, or some combination. This is a multi-year process at minimum.

Fannie Mae earned ~$4.0B in Q1; Freddie Mac posted ~$2.5B. Combined equity of ~$145B was growing but still insufficient for ERCF compliance without regulatory adjustments. No g-fee changes were announced, though the new FHFA director signaled a review of the fee structure was forthcoming.

CRT issuance was active at ~$3.5B for Q1, with both CAS and STACR programs continuing. CRT spreads were volatile, widening to DM+220-240bps on the M2 tranches as privatization uncertainty created headline risk for structured GSE products.

## Origination & Primary Market

Total origination volume came in around $360B, split ~$200B purchase / $160B refi, with refi share at ~30%. The tariff-driven uncertainty had a chilling effect on consumer confidence, with MBA application indices showing week-to-week volatility tracking policy announcements. Purchase applications were particularly sensitive—home buyers don't want to make the largest financial decision of their lives during maximum economic uncertainty.

Non-QM continued its growth trajectory with ~$28B in Q1 originations. The segment was increasingly professionalized, with dedicated conduit desks at major dealers and a maturing investor base. DSCR investor loans remained the fastest-growing subcategory as institutional and retail rental investors continued to build portfolios.

Credit quality remained strong: average FICO ~748, LTV ~78%, DTI ~37%. No credit box expansion despite originator desire for volume—lenders remained disciplined, haunted by the memory of 2006-2007 vintage origination quality.

## Prepayment & Convexity

CPR trends were flat at 5.5-6.0% aggregate, all turnover-driven. Nothing new to report on the S-curve or burnout dynamics—rates in the mid-6s generate essentially zero refinance incentive for any meaningful cohort. The 2020-2021 vintages continued at 3.5-5.0 CPR.

Convexity was mildly concerning in Q1 as elevated rate volatility increased option value and negative convexity. Duration on UMBS 6.0% bounced between 5.6-6.4 years depending on the rate of the day, making hedging more expensive and portfolio duration less predictable. Implied volatility on 1y10y swaptions rose ~8bps from December levels, reflecting genuine uncertainty about the rate path.

## Housing & Credit

Existing home sales were marginally better at 4.15M SAAR, continuing the glacial improvement trend. Inventory reached 4.3 months of supply. Case-Shiller decelerated further to +3.2% YoY—the slowest appreciation since 2020 and approaching historical norms. Whether this was healthy normalization or the beginning of a price correction depended on your tariff and employment outlook.

Housing starts slipped to 1.30M SAAR, the weakest since mid-2023, as builder confidence faded on tariff uncertainty (lumber and appliance costs) and elevated rates. Delinquency rates held at 3.7% (30+ days), stable. The institutional investor SFR ban—announced in early March by the administration—created headlines but its practical market impact was unclear, as institutional buyers had already pulled back significantly from the frenzy of 2021-2022.

## Non-Agency & Structured Products

CMBS issuance was ~$22B for Q1. Non-agency RMBS hit ~$18B. CLO issuance was robust at ~$42B. Agency CMO issuance of ~$38B reflected steady demand despite the uncertainty backdrop. CRT deal spreads widened on privatization noise but remained within their post-COVID range.

## Key Events & Narrative

**Tariffs became the macro story.** The administration's aggressive tariff posture created a new source of uncertainty for all risk assets, including MBS. The inflation/growth trade-off from tariffs is genuinely difficult to price: they're stagflationary (inflationary + growth-negative), which is the worst possible macro combination for fixed income and housing. The Fed's response—pause and assess—was the only sensible approach, but it left the market without a clear rate path.

**GSE privatization went from theoretical to aspirational.** The new FHFA director's public comments and the $200B purchase directive proposal moved privatization from a "someday maybe" concept to an "this administration wants to do this" reality. The actual timeline is years, and the execution risk is enormous, but the market now has to price in non-trivial probability of structural change to the agency MBS guarantee. For basis traders, this is a widening risk; for equity investors in GSE preferreds, it's a moonshot trade.

**The institutional SFR ban.** The administration's ban on institutional investors (>1,000 units) purchasing single-family homes for rental purposes was populist housing policy at its most visible. Practical impact on MBS? Minimal—institutional SFR buyers haven't been a meaningful share of purchase volume since 2022, and the ban applies to bulk purchases, not the loan-level activity that drives agency securitization. But it signaled a broader hostility toward financialization of housing that could affect non-agency investor and DSCR lending markets over time.
