## Rates & Yield Curve

Q4 2025 delivered the sustained rate relief the housing market had been starved of for three years. The Fed cut 25bps at both the November and December meetings, bringing the funds rate to 3.50-3.75%—a cumulative 175bps of easing since September 2024's first cut. Core PCE continued its grind lower toward 2.2%, and unemployment held at ~4.4%, providing the Goldilocks backdrop the FOMC needed to continue normalizing policy without appearing reactive.

The 10-year Treasury averaged approximately 3.95%—below 4% for the first time since early 2024—as the term premium compressed with declining inflation expectations and geopolitical tariff risks remaining contained. The 30-year mortgage rate averaged approximately 6.15%, breaking decisively below the 6.25% level that had served as resistance for over a year. By late December, spot rates dipped to approximately 5.95%, flirting with the psychologically significant sub-6% level. The 15-year fixed averaged ~5.40%.

The 2s10s curve continued steepening to approximately +40bps, a constructive bull steepening pattern that signaled the easing cycle was progressing normally without recession panic. MBS OAS tightened to approximately 35bps—the tightest since Q3 2024—driven by a confluence of positive technicals: GSE retained portfolio purchases, declining rate vol, real money demand rotation back into spread product, and a constructive supply/demand picture.

## Agency MBS Market

Gross agency issuance surged to approximately $260B, the highest quarterly volume since Q1 2022, as the rate decline activated genuine refi activity alongside seasonally strong purchase demand. Production concentrated in UMBS 5.5% and 6.0% coupons, with 5.0%s entering production for the first time since 2022. The coupon migration was one of the most significant shifts of the year—new supply in 5.5s created structuring opportunities while reducing relative value in the 6.0-6.5% stack.

Outstanding agency MBS stock edged up to ~$8.9T as gross issuance outpaced principal paydowns and QT runoff for the first time in over a year. Fed MBS holdings declined to approximately $1.88T. The December FOMC minutes included a discussion about "the appropriate endpoint" for MBS runoff, with several members suggesting the current pace could slow in early 2026 as the portfolio approached the $1.7-1.8T range considered consistent with the Committee's ample reserves framework.

The GSE retained portfolio purchase program accelerated to approximately $12-15B/month by Q4, bringing cumulative purchases since the August launch to approximately $60B. This was becoming a meaningful technical factor—essentially replacing a portion of the demand lost from Fed QT. Whether it represented sound policy or a backdoor QE was debated, but for basis traders, the bid was real and welcome.

Specified pool pay-ups expanded meaningfully. Low loan balance (LLB) stories on 5.5% and 6.0% coupons commanded 8-12 tick pay-ups—the highest since early 2022. New York/Puerto Rico stories saw 6-8 ticks. Even investor and low FICO stories showed 2-4 ticks of pay-up as the market anticipated further rate declines. The pay-up curve was back, and with it came the return of specified pool trading as a meaningful alpha source for agency MBS portfolios.

Dollar rolls in 30yr 5.5% and 6.0% TBAs went significantly special through November and December, with roll specialness reaching 15-20 ticks in 5.5% TBAs as originator hedge selling overwhelmed available float. Roll implied financing rates dropped below 3%—a clear signal of excess demand for current production relative to supply.

## GSE & Regulatory

Fannie Mae reported estimated Q4 net income of ~$4.5B; Freddie Mac ~$2.8B, bringing full-year 2025 estimates to approximately $16.5B (Fannie) and $10.2B (Freddie). Combined 2025 net income of ~$26.7B was slightly below 2024's ~$27.4B as the rate decline compressed NIM, but credit costs remained negligible.

The privatization timeline remained ambitious but increasingly realistic. The FHFA Blueprint from Q3 was followed by a Treasury white paper in November outlining the economic rationale for GSE privatization and the proposed structure for an explicit, paid-for guarantee on agency MBS. The key detail: an annual guarantee fee (in addition to the existing g-fee) of approximately 10-15bps on outstanding MBS, paid into a dedicated government guarantee fund. This would create a self-sustaining explicit wrap that the market could price with confidence—essentially converting the current implicit guarantee into an explicit, congressionally-mandated backstop.

Legislative activity began in earnest. The Senate Banking Committee held hearings in December, and a bipartisan group of Senators introduced preliminary framework legislation. The bill was early-stage but addressed the critical elements: explicit guarantee, capital requirements, CRT program continuation, affordable housing obligations, and a multi-year transition timeline. The market response was modestly constructive: agency MBS spreads tightened 2-3bps on the announcement, suggesting that the probability of a "bad" privatization outcome (weakened guarantee) was declining.

The 2026 conforming loan limit was announced at $850,200—a 5.4% increase reflecting 2025 home price appreciation. G-fees remained unchanged, though the guarantee fund proposal would effectively add 10-15bps to total guarantee costs if enacted. CRT issuance finished 2025 at approximately $14.5B, consistent with recent years.

## Origination & Primary Market

Total origination volume of approximately $450B was the strongest quarter since Q4 2022, with meaningful contributions from both purchase ($240B) and refinance ($210B). Refi share climbed to ~37%—the highest since Q1 2022's rate-shock-driven final refi burst. The refinanceable universe at sub-6.25% rates had expanded to approximately $600B of outstanding loans, and with rates touching 5.95% by December, the first genuine refi wave since 2021 was forming.

Full-year 2025 origination volume came in around ~$1.55T—modestly above 2024's ~$1.5T and showing that the recovery, while slow, was real and accelerating. Purchase originations of approximately $850B for the year were the strongest since 2021. The refi component of ~$700B was still a fraction of 2020-2021 levels but represented a dramatic improvement from 2023's trough.

Non-QM origination for Q4 was approximately $32B, bringing full-year to ~$117B—another record and a testament to the maturing non-agency market. Private-label securitization for 2025 totaled approximately $78B, surpassing 2024's ~$70B cycle high.

Credit quality remained strong: average origination FICO of ~747, LTV of ~78%, DTI of ~38%. The modest loosening from prior years reflected improved affordability (lower rates) expanding the eligible borrower pool rather than any deterioration in underwriting standards. The jumbo-conforming spread compressed to ~20bps.

## Prepayment & Convexity

Prepayment speeds accelerated meaningfully. Aggregate 30yr CPR reached 7.5-9.0%—the highest readings since early 2022—driven by rate/term refi activity in the 2023-2024 vintage cohorts. The 6.5% coupon printed 14-18 CPR; 7.0%s printed 18-24 CPR. The S-curve was fully re-engaged for recent vintages, with refi efficiency at ~45% at 75bps incentive—still below historical norms but normalizing.

The 2020-2021 vintage low coupons (2.5s, 3.0s, 3.5s) remained at 4-5 CPR. These borrowers need rates in the 2-3% range and nothing in the macro outlook suggests that's plausible. For practical purposes, this cohort is "permanent"—call protection that money managers can count on for the duration of these bonds' remaining life.

Convexity was well-behaved throughout Q4. Declining rate volatility compressed negative convexity, and the directional rate move (lower) shortened MBS duration in a way that was manageable for hedgers. Duration on UMBS 5.5% sat at approximately 4.8-5.2 years, with convexity metrics inside any risk management threshold. No notable convexity events—this was the environment MBS managers dream about.

## Housing & Credit

The housing market showed its most genuine improvement since before the rate shock. Existing home sales reached approximately 4.40M SAAR—still below the 5.0M+ levels of 2017-2019 but representing a 10%+ improvement from the 2023-2024 trough. The lock-in effect was slowly eroding: while the majority of outstanding mortgages remained below 5%, life events (job changes, family growth, retirement) were forcing turnover despite the rate differential. Sub-6% rates expected in early 2026 would further accelerate this thaw.

Inventory reached approximately 4.8 months of supply—approaching (but not yet at) balanced market levels. Case-Shiller showed +2.5% YoY, essentially real-price-flat—healthy after the unsustainable 15-20% appreciation rates of 2021-2022. Housing starts recovered to 1.40M SAAR as builder confidence improved with lower rates and reduced material cost uncertainty post-tariff-détente.

Delinquency rates were stable at 3.8% (30+ days). Serious delinquency (90+ days) remained under 2%. Full-year 2025 foreclosure starts were the lowest since pre-pandemic 2019. The housing credit story remained the dog that didn't bark: three years of rate shock, affordability crisis, and macro uncertainty, and the credit performance of the mortgage market was essentially flawless—a testament to post-GFC underwriting discipline and the massive equity cushion supporting homeowner balance sheets.

## Non-Agency & Structured Products

Full-year 2025 CMBS issuance came in around $110B, modestly above 2024. Non-agency RMBS of ~$78B for the year was a post-GFC record. CLO issuance was robust. Agency CMO issuance of ~$55B in Q4 reflected the increased structuring opportunities from coupon migration and rising issuance—PAC, sequential, and Z-bond production all increased as the structured product desk came back to life after years of limited collateral.

CRT performance remained excellent. With 2025 marking the 12th year of the CRT program, cumulative credit losses on post-2013 vintage GSE originations were effectively zero. The M2 tranches were being consumed by prepayments and natural amortization rather than losses—a remarkable track record that increasingly argued for tighter spread valuations.

## Key Events & Narrative

**The normalization trade is finally working.** After three years of rate shock, housing freeze, and repeated disappointment, Q4 2025 delivered what bulls had been waiting for: sub-6.25% mortgage rates, rising purchase and refi activity, improving inventory, stable credit, and a constructive Fed trajectory. We're not back to "normal" yet—existing sales are still 20% below pre-pandemic levels and affordability remains challenged—but the direction of travel is clear and the pace is accelerating. This is what the beginning of a recovery looks like.

**GSE reform gains legislative momentum.** The bipartisan Senate framework legislation was the most significant congressional action on housing finance reform since the Corker-Warner days of 2013-2014. The emphasis on explicit guarantee, maintained CRT program, and multi-year transition timeline were all constructive for MBS investors. Our base case: preliminary legislation passes in 2026, with full implementation and conservatorship exit by 2028-2029. The key risk is political—a change in administration or congressional composition could derail the process entirely.

**The return of the specified pool market.** After three years of effectively zero pay-ups, the revival of the specified pool market in Q4 signals that prepayment risk is once again a live concern for agency MBS investors. Low loan balance pay-ups at 8-12 ticks represent the beginning—if rates break below 6% sustainably in 2026, pay-ups on prepayment-protected stories could reach 20-30 ticks. For portfolio managers who maintained specified pool expertise through the drought years, the payoff is beginning. For those who let the muscle atrophy: time to rehire your spec pool traders.

We enter 2026 with more optimism than at any point since 2021. Rates are declining toward 6%, the Fed has room for 100-150bps more cuts, the housing market is thawing, non-agency markets are functioning, credit quality is pristine, and the GSE reform process—while uncertain—is at least progressing constructively. The biggest risks are geopolitical (tariff re-escalation), inflationary (energy shocks, supply chain disruption), and political (GSE reform derailment). But for the first time in this cycle, the base case scenario for mortgage markets is genuinely positive. Don't fight it.

> **Closing the loop — 48 quarters, six feedback loops, one market.** This is the final installment in a series that began in 2014 Q1 with the identification of six interconnected feedback loops that define the mortgage complex. Twelve years later, every loop has activated, reversed, and reactivated — some multiple times:
>
> **(1) Fed balance sheet ↔ MBS basis:** From QE3 taper (2014) → reinvestment (2015-2017) → QT1 launch (2017 Q4) → QT1 termination (2019 Q1) → COVID emergency QE (2020 Q1) → QE taper 2.0 (2021 Q4) → QT2 (2022 Q2-present) → approaching endpoint (2026). The most powerful single variable in MBS pricing traversed the full cycle twice in twelve years.
>
> **(2) Rates ↔ prepayments ↔ convexity ↔ rates:** The reflexive loop drove the 2016 and 2019-2021 refi waves, the 2022 Q1 liquidation event, and every convexity hedging cascade in between. The specified pool pay-up lifecycle — from single-digit ticks (2014, 2018) to 4-5 points (2020 Q3) to extinction (2022 Q3) and now back to 8-12 ticks (here) — is its clearest manifestation.
>
> **(3) Lock-in effect ↔ inventory ↔ prices ↔ affordability:** Dormant until 2022 Q1, then the defining structural feature of the housing market for three years. The 80% of borrowers locked into sub-4% mortgages froze turnover, strangled inventory, supported prices, and trapped first-time buyers. Only now, with rates approaching 6%, is the ice beginning to crack.
>
> **(4) Origination volume ↔ MBS supply ↔ basis ↔ Fed demand:** From $4.4T (2021) to $1.3T (2023) to $1.55T (2025). The origination cycle — and its supply-demand implications for MBS technicals — proved more volatile than any prior cycle.
>
> **(5) Credit quality ↔ CRT pricing ↔ GSE capital ↔ privatization path:** The CRT program's 12 years of effectively zero realized losses built the capital base ($140B+) and track record that enabled the first serious privatization push since conservatorship. Feedback loop #5 is now the dominant structural question for the next twelve years.
>
> **(6) Non-agency recovery ↔ credit box ↔ housing access ↔ agency dominance:** PLS issuance recovered from $0 (GFC aftermath) to $78B (2025), but agency dominance remains >90%. The credit box barely loosened. Whether privatization changes this calculus is the open question.
>
> *The mortgage market is a system, not a collection of independent variables. The feedback loops interact, amplify, and occasionally cancel each other in ways that linear models cannot capture. That has been the thesis of this series from the beginning, and twelve years of evidence have only strengthened it. Whatever comes next — further rate normalization, GSE privatization, the next crisis we can't yet name — it will propagate through the same loops. Watch them.*
