# Q2 2018 Mortgage Market Recap
## Rates Break Out, Refi Dies, and the Curve Stays Brutally Flat

### Executive Summary

Q2 2018 marked a decisive shift in the mortgage market as rates breached multi-year thresholds and the refinance trade effectively died. The 30-year mortgage rate averaged 4.54% for the quarter—the highest sustained level since 2014—while the 10-year Treasury pierced 3.00% on May 17th for the first time since 2011. The Fed's June rate hike brought the funds rate to 1.75-2.00%, accompanied by an unexpectedly hawkish dot plot projecting four hikes for 2018 (up from three). Against this backdrop, MBS spreads continued their grinding wider, specified pool pay-ups compressed as prepayments slowed to a crawl, and the 2s10s curve sat pinned at a punishingly flat 46bps average. For MBS investors, it was a quarter defined by duration extension, diminishing convexity concerns, and a market structurally adjusting to life without the refi borrower.

### Rates and Fed Policy: Breaking Through

The defining moment of Q2 came on May 17th when the 10-year Treasury yield touched 3.11%, breaking through the psychologically critical 3% barrier for the first time in seven years. The move was driven by a confluence of factors: stronger-than-expected economic data, rising inflation expectations, concerns about fiscal deficits following tax reform, and global rate volatility emanating from Europe. For the quarter, 10-year yields averaged 2.93%, representing a meaningful backup from Q1 levels.

The Fed delivered its second rate hike of 2018 on June 13th, lifting the funds rate 25bps to a range of 1.75-2.00%. More significantly, the accompanying dot plot shifted hawkish, with the median projection now showing four rate hikes for 2018 versus the three previously anticipated. This recalibration reflected the FOMC's growing confidence in the economic expansion and their willingness to normalize policy more aggressively despite muted inflation prints and a flattening curve.

That flattening curve remained a persistent concern. The 2s10s spread averaged just 46bps during Q2, one of the flattest configurations since the pre-crisis period. The compression reflected market skepticism about the durability of growth and inflation, even as the Fed pressed forward with rate hikes. For MBS investors, the flat curve environment had important implications: it supported demand for MBS carry trades while simultaneously raising questions about the economic cycle's longevity.

Mortgage rates moved decisively higher in sympathy with Treasuries. The 30-year conventional rate averaged 4.54% for the quarter, with the 15-year at 4.00%. These levels represented a substantial move from the sub-4% environment that had prevailed for much of the post-crisis period and had critical implications for housing activity and prepayment behavior.

### MBS Technicals: Spreads Widen, Convexity Disappears

MBS spreads continued their relentless widening trend, with OAS levels reaching approximately 32bps by quarter-end—meaningfully wider than the tight levels seen in 2017. The widening reflected several technical factors: the Fed's quantitative tightening (QT) program capped at $12B monthly for MBS, reduced bank demand as balance sheet constraints bit, and diminished convexity hedging flows as prepayment speeds collapsed.

The Fed's MBS holdings stood at approximately $1.73T, declining gradually under the QT program. While the runoff pace remained modest relative to the overall market, the removal of the Fed as a consistent bid represented a structural shift. Money managers and banks had to absorb more supply, and they demanded compensation.

Current coupon production centered on the 4.0% and 4.5% coupons, reflecting the higher rate environment. Gross agency issuance totaled approximately $290B for the quarter, declining from prior periods as origination volumes contracted. The combination of reduced issuance and lower prepayment speeds actually provided some technical support, but it wasn't enough to offset the demand headwinds.

Specified pool pay-ups compressed significantly as the prepayment environment shifted. Low loan balance pools, high FICO pools, and other prepayment-protected stories that had commanded substantial premiums in 2017 saw their pay-ups decline as generic pool speeds dropped to levels that made the incremental protection less valuable. When you're already at 6-8 CPR on generics, paying up 50-100 ticks for a story that delivers 4-5 CPR doesn't pencil. The spec pool market became a casualty of the higher rate environment.

### Credit and Housing Fundamentals: Still Solid

Despite the rate backup, underlying credit quality remained exceptionally strong. Fannie Mae reported Q2 net income of approximately $4.0B, while Freddie Mac posted $2.4B. Both GSEs continued to benefit from benign credit conditions, rising home prices, and the tailwind of seasoned portfolios with substantial home equity cushions.

Delinquency rates remained near historic lows, with 90+ day delinquencies at approximately 0.8%. Loan-level performance was stellar, reflecting tight underwriting standards, strong borrower credit profiles (average FICO on new production in the 740+ range), and home price appreciation that provided equity buffers.

Speaking of home prices, the Case-Shiller index showed year-over-year appreciation of approximately 6.4%—a robust pace that raised affordability concerns but provided strong credit support. Existing home sales ran at approximately 5.4M seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR), while housing starts came in around 1.27M SAAR. The housing market was showing some signs of moderation as affordability constraints began to bind, but overall activity remained healthy by historical standards.

The credit risk transfer (CRT) market remained active, with both GSEs bringing strong issuance pipelines. Spreads widened modestly in sympathy with broader credit markets, but demand remained solid from insurance companies, asset managers, and hedge funds seeking floating-rate credit exposure. The CRT market had become a well-established component of the GSE credit risk management framework.

### Origination: The Refi Trade Dies

Total mortgage origination for Q2 came in at approximately $340B, split roughly evenly between purchase ($175B) and refinance ($165B). The refi share of approximately 48% represented a meaningful decline from prior quarters and signaled the effective death of the rate-driven refinance wave.

With rates at 4.54%, the pool of borrowers with economic incentive to refinance had shrunk dramatically. The typical breakeven for a rate-term refi sits around 75-100bps of rate improvement; with most recent vintage production carrying coupons in the 3.50-4.00% range, there simply wasn't enough incentive. The refinance borrowers still active in Q2 were predominantly cash-out borrowers tapping home equity rather than rate-motivated transactions.

This shift had profound implications for prepayment models and MBS valuation. The higher-coupon universe (4.5% and above) that had exhibited elevated speeds in prior years was now seasoning into stable, low-prepayment collateral. The 3.5% and 4.0% production that represented the bulk of outstanding MBS had effectively zero refinance risk at current rate levels.

For originators, the shift from refi to purchase also meant changing economics: longer cycle times, more complex transactions, greater coordination with real estate agents, and different channel dynamics. The independent mortgage bank (IMB) channel, which had dominated refi activity, faced margin pressure as volumes declined.

### Convexity and Duration: Extension Relief

The silver lining in the rate backup was the effective disappearance of negative convexity concerns. For years, MBS investors had worried about prepayment surges and duration compression if rates rallied. That risk had essentially vanished by Q2 2018.

With rates well above the prevailing coupon stack, MBS were extending rather than compressing. Current production 4.0s and 4.5s were exhibiting durations in the 5.5-6.0 year range—longer than in recent memory. Older, lower-coupon production (3.0s and 3.5s) were extending even more dramatically, with durations pushing toward 7-8 years as prepayment speeds dropped into the single digits.

This extension dynamic was double-edged. On one hand, it meant MBS were behaving more like duration-matched Treasuries or agencies, reducing hedge costs and eliminating convexity-driven selling pressure. On the other hand, it meant that the duration gap between MBS and benchmark Treasuries had widened, creating potential P&L volatility if rates moved sharply.

For portfolio managers, the low-prepayment environment opened up opportunities in seasoned collateral. Older pools with original coupons well below current market rates were trading at discounts but offering attractive yields with minimal prepayment risk. The discount MBS trade gained traction as investors sought yield without taking significant credit or extension risk.

### Macro Crosscurrents: Trade Wars and EM Stress

The broader macro environment in Q2 was characterized by rising uncertainty. The Trump administration escalated trade tensions with China, implementing tariffs and threatening additional measures. While the immediate economic impact was modest, the uncertainty weighed on sentiment and raised questions about the sustainability of global growth.

European markets experienced volatility around Italian political developments, with concerns about a populist government's fiscal policies and euro membership driving spread widening and periodic flights to quality. While the direct impact on US MBS was limited, the episode contributed to broader risk-off sentiment.

Emerging markets came under significant pressure during the quarter, with Turkey and Argentina experiencing currency crises that required emergency policy responses. The EM stress reflected the impact of a stronger dollar, rising US rates, and idiosyncratic political and economic challenges. For US fixed income, EM turmoil provided periodic safe-haven flows that supported Treasuries and, by extension, MBS.

### UMBS Development: Preparing for the TBA Revolution

Behind the scenes, significant work continued on the Single Security/Uniform MBS (UMBS) initiative. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, under FHFA direction, were preparing for the June 2019 launch of a unified MBS that would replace the separate Fannie and Freddie TBA-eligible securities.

The UMBS project aimed to improve liquidity and price discovery by creating a single fungible security backed by either Fannie or Freddie loans. The initiative required significant operational work: aligning payment dates, harmonizing disclosure requirements, and managing the technical transition for the existing stock of securities.

For market participants, UMBS preparation meant system updates, operational changes, and strategic thinking about the implications for TBA trading, basis relationships, and pool selection. The "to-pool" swap market—exchanging Freddie pools for Fannie pools ahead of the transition—became increasingly active as investors positioned for the unified security.

### Outlook: Life Without the Refi Borrower

As Q2 2018 closed, the mortgage market had fundamentally shifted. The refi borrower—the dominant force in prepayment behavior for much of the post-crisis period—had largely exited the market. MBS were extending, convexity was minimal, and valuations reflected a structural bid from accounts seeking duration and yield in a flat curve environment.

Looking ahead to the second half of 2018, several themes appeared likely to dominate: continued Fed hiking with an increasingly flat or potentially inverted curve, sustained MBS spread pressure from technical headwinds, ongoing housing market moderation as affordability constrained activity, and the final preparations for UMBS implementation.

For MBS investors, the message was clear: embrace the new paradigm of stable, low-prepayment collateral, focus on carry and rolldown rather than convexity alpha, and prepare for a market structure transition with UMBS. The refi borrower might return someday if rates collapsed, but for now, the mortgage market was learning to live without its most volatile participant. In many ways, that was exactly what the market needed.
