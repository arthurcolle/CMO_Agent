## Rates & Yield Curve

Q3 2025 brought cautious relief after Q2's tariff-driven stress. In early July, the administration reached a preliminary trade framework with the EU and a "Phase 1.5" deal with China that rolled back some of the most punitive reciprocal tariffs, replacing them with more targeted sector-specific duties. Markets rallied sharply on the news: the 10-year Treasury fell from 4.45% to 4.05% in two weeks, and risk appetite returned. The quarterly average of ~4.15% was a significant improvement from Q2's 4.45%.

The Fed resumed cutting. After holding at 4.25-4.50% through the first half of the year, the FOMC delivered a 25bp cut on September 17 to 4.00-4.25%, citing "diminished upside risks to inflation following trade policy normalization" and "softening in labor market conditions." Unemployment had ticked to 4.5% by the August employment report, and core PCE had decelerated to ~2.4%, providing the committee cover to resume the easing cycle.

The 30-year mortgage rate responded favorably, averaging ~6.40% for Q3 and dipping below 6.25% by late September—the lowest level since Q3 2024's post-first-cut euphoria. The 2s10s curve steepened to approximately +35bps as the front end fell faster than the long end—a constructive bull steepening pattern. MBS OAS tightened from Q2's ~48bps wides to approximately 40bps as rate vol declined and risk appetite normalized.

## Agency MBS Market

Gross issuance improved to approximately $230B as falling rates stimulated both purchase and early-stage refi activity. Production shifted downward: UMBS 5.5% and 6.0% became primary production coupons, with 6.5%s fading. The coupon migration was orderly and well-absorbed by TBA markets.

The GSE $200B purchase directive was formally launched in August, though initial implementation was modest. Fannie and Freddie began purchasing approximately $8-10B/month of agency MBS for their retained portfolios—well below the directive's theoretical pace but meaningful as a new source of demand layered on top of existing real money flows. Fed MBS holdings continued declining to approximately $1.95T, crossing below the $2T mark for the first time since 2020.

Specified pool pay-ups showed modest revival on 5.5% and 6.0% coupons, with low loan balance stories seeing 4-6 tick pay-ups as rates approaching 6% raised the possibility of eventual refinanceability for higher-balance borrowers. New York stories picked up 2-3 ticks. The pay-up curve was coming alive after a three-year hibernation.

Dollar rolls in 30yr 5.5% TBAs went notably special during August and September as originator hedge supply outpaced CMO takedown capacity in the transition coupon. Fails rates remained low but the specialness indicated a healthier, more active market.

## GSE & Regulatory

The privatization debate crystallized. FHFA published a "Blueprint for Responsible Exit from Conservatorship" in August, laying out a three-phase process: (1) capital accumulation through retained earnings and potential secondary offerings (2026-2028), (2) establishment of an explicit paid-for government guarantee backstopping agency MBS (requiring Congressional action), and (3) Treasury warrant exercise and conservatorship termination.

The market largely welcomed the Blueprint's emphasis on an explicit guarantee—the key structural element that would preserve agency MBS's status as near-Treasury credit quality. However, Congressional appetite for legislation remained uncertain, and the administration acknowledged that Phase 2 required bipartisan support. CRT investors took comfort in the Blueprint's language about maintaining credit risk transfer programs post-conservatorship.

Fannie Mae earned approximately $4.2B in Q3; Freddie Mac ~$2.7B, with earnings benefiting from the improved rate environment and continued negligible credit losses. Combined equity reached ~$155B.

CRT issuance rebounded to ~$4B for Q3 as spread volatility subsided. M2 tranche spreads tightened to DM+200-220bps, benefiting from the improved macro outlook and the Blueprint's positive implications for CRT program continuity.

## Origination & Primary Market

Total origination volume rebounded to approximately $400B as the rate improvement and tariff détente boosted confidence. Purchase volume of ~$220B reflected seasonal strength plus genuine improvement in buyer activity. Refi volume of ~$180B included the first meaningful rate/term refi activity in over two years as borrowers who originated at 7%+ in 2023-2024 found 100bps+ savings at sub-6.5% rates. Refi share ticked up to ~33%.

The MBA refinance index rose to its highest level since Q3 2024, though still dramatically below the 2020-2021 peaks. The refinanceable universe at sub-6.25% rates was estimated at approximately $400B of outstanding loans—a fraction of the $3-4T universe that existed during the 2020-2021 wave but large enough to support a multi-quarter origination recovery.

Non-QM volume improved to ~$30B, with full-year tracking toward ~$115B. The segment continued to professionalize with more standardized underwriting, improved data transparency, and deeper securitization markets.

## Prepayment & Convexity

CPR trends showed genuine acceleration for the first time since the hiking cycle began. Aggregate 30yr speeds rose to 6.5-7.5 CPR, with the bulk of the acceleration in 2023-2024 vintage 6.5% and 7.0% coupons that were 50-100bps+ in the money. These cohorts printed 10-14 CPR—not fast by historical standards but a sea change from the 6-8 CPR we'd observed for the prior two years.

The low-coupon vintages (2.5s, 3.0s, 3.5s) remained at 3.5-5.0 CPR, as expected. These borrowers would need rates in the 2-3% range to have meaningful refinance incentive, which is not in any realistic scenario.

The S-curve was re-engaging at the margin. For the 6.5%+ cohorts, refi efficiency was approximately 40% at 75bps incentive—lower than historical norms, reflecting borrower caution, tighter capacity, and higher closing costs. But the S-curve was no longer flat.

Convexity improved meaningfully in Q3. Rate volatility declined as tariff uncertainty resolved, reducing option value and negative convexity. Duration on UMBS 6.0% stabilized at ~5.5 years, making hedging more predictable and portfolio management less costly.

## Housing & Credit

Existing home sales improved to approximately 4.20M SAAR, the best quarterly print since late 2022 and a signal that the housing market was finally responding to lower rates and improving confidence. The lock-in effect remained a structural overhang—still ~75% of outstanding mortgages below 5%—but at the margin, the incentive to hold was eroding for borrowers who needed to relocate for employment or life changes.

Inventory continued its gradual improvement at 4.6 months of supply. Case-Shiller decelerated to +2.0% YoY—effectively flat in real terms. The market was finding equilibrium: modest price appreciation, improving volume, and gradual inventory normalization. This is what a healthy housing market looks like, and it's been a long time coming.

Housing starts recovered to 1.32M SAAR as the tariff détente reduced lumber cost uncertainty and builders regained confidence. Delinquency rates stabilized at 3.8% (30+ days), with the tariff-related stress in Q2 not translating into meaningful credit deterioration. The employment picture—while softer than 2023-2024—remained solid enough to support mortgage performance.

## Non-Agency & Structured Products

CMBS issuance improved to ~$28B. Non-agency RMBS hit ~$22B as private-label issuance continued its multi-year recovery. CLO issuance normalized at ~$40B. Agency CMO issuance of ~$45B reflected increased structuring activity as the coupon migration provided fresh collateral.

## Key Events & Narrative

**Tariff détente changed the macro story.** The July trade framework removed the tail risk of full-blown trade war and allowed markets to price a more normal macro outlook. For MBS, this meant lower rate vol, tighter spreads, and improved housing activity. The damage from Q2's shock wasn't fully reversed, but the trajectory improved markedly.

**The GSE Blueprint was a milestone.** Whatever you think about privatization timing or execution risk, the FHFA's publication of a formal roadmap was the most significant GSE policy development since the 2012 net worth sweep. The emphasis on explicit guarantee preservation was the critical detail for MBS investors—it means the structural credit quality of agency MBS should survive privatization, even if spreads carry a modest risk premium during the transition period.

**Prepayments are alive—barely.** For the first time since 2022, we can write about prepayment acceleration with a straight face. It's concentrated in recent vintages and it's modest, but the S-curve is no longer dead. For pay-up stories, this is the beginning of the recovery—and specified pool traders should be positioning for a sustained move below 6%.
