## Rates & Yield Curve

Q2 2025 was dominated by the tariff escalation that the market had been fearing since January. "Liberation Day" (April 2)—the administration's announcement of sweeping reciprocal tariffs across virtually all trading partners—sent risk assets reeling. The S&P 500 dropped 10%+ in the subsequent two weeks. 10-year Treasury yields initially fell to ~4.0% on flight-to-quality before backing up sharply to 4.6%+ as inflation expectations surged and foreign holders (notably China and Japan) reportedly reduced Treasury holdings, creating the unusual dynamic of a risk-off event with *rising* long-term yields.

The 30-year mortgage rate averaged approximately 6.85% for Q2, backing up from Q1's 6.65% as the long end sold off. The Fed held steady at both the May 7 and June 18 FOMC meetings, with Powell explicitly stating that tariff-related inflation uncertainty required patience. The June dot plot was essentially unchanged: two cuts projected for 2025, but the conviction behind those dots was visibly low. The market began pricing in the possibility of zero 2025 cuts.

MBS OAS widened to approximately 48bps—the widest since Q4 2023—as elevated rate volatility, macro uncertainty, and reduced risk appetite pressured the basis. Foreign central banks and Japanese bank demand for agency MBS—historically a major source of support—pulled back amid dollar volatility and the geopolitical uncertainty surrounding tariff negotiations.

The 2s10s curve fluctuated between +15 and +35bps, with the shape oscillating between bull flattening (recession fears) and bear steepening (inflation/supply fears). This whipsaw was uncomfortable for duration-managed portfolios and increased hedging costs across the mortgage complex.

## Agency MBS Market

Gross issuance slipped to ~$195B as elevated rates and consumer uncertainty dampened both purchase and refi activity. Production was in UMBS 6.5% and 6.0% coupons. Outstanding stock was essentially flat at ~$8.8T. Fed holdings declined to approximately $2.02T, inching closer to the $2T level that some market participants viewed as a potential QT endpoint, though the Fed gave no formal guidance.

TBA liquidity deteriorated modestly during the most acute tariff stress in April, with bid-ask spreads widening 1-2 ticks in the most liquid coupons and more in the wings. Dollar rolls showed modest fails rates in 6.0% TBAs during the April volatility—nothing systemic but a reminder that liquidity isn't guaranteed in stress.

The GSE $200B purchase directive remained under discussion but had not been formally implemented by quarter-end. Legal challenges and interagency coordination delayed what the administration had hoped would be a quick-launch initiative. The uncertainty itself—will they or won't they—created a persistent bid in the basis that partially offset the macro widening pressure.

## GSE & Regulatory

Fannie Mae earned an estimated ~$3.8B in Q2; Freddie Mac ~$2.3B. Earnings showed modest compression as market-related fair value losses offset steady core income. Combined equity continued to build toward ~$150B.

The privatization debate intensified. FHFA published a request for information (RFI) on "administrative options for ending conservatorship," signaling that the agency was serious about exploring pathways. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan published research pieces laying out potential privatization structures, ranging from a full IPO with explicit government guarantee to a utility-model with regulated returns. Common stock creation, preferred share conversion, and warrant exercise by Treasury all remained on the table.

For MBS investors, the key question remained: what happens to the implicit guarantee? The current architecture—conservatorship with Treasury backstop—provides a de facto full faith and credit guarantee on agency MBS, which is why spreads are 35-50bps rather than 100-150bps. Any privatization structure that weakens this guarantee would require a massive repricing of agency MBS. The market's base case remained that Congress would legislate an explicit guarantee as part of any privatization bill, but the gap between "base case" and "certainty" kept a risk premium in spreads.

CRT issuance of ~$3B for Q2 was slightly below trend as deal execution became more challenging amid spread volatility. CRT M2 spreads widened to DM+240-260bps.

## Origination & Primary Market

Total origination volume fell to approximately $340B as consumer confidence cratered post-Liberation Day. Purchase applications dropped ~15% in the weeks following the tariff announcement before partially recovering. Refi share held at ~28%. Cash-out refis actually increased as borrowers pulled forward home equity extraction amid economic uncertainty—counterintuitive but consistent with precautionary liquidity behavior.

Non-QM origination was flat at ~$27B as private lenders adopted a more cautious stance. DSCR investor loans saw particular scrutiny as rental market uncertainty (potential tariff-driven inflation affecting rent growth) complicated underwriting. The institutional SFR ban from Q1 had minimal volume impact but was affecting market sentiment.

## Prepayment & Convexity

Speeds ticked down slightly to 5.2-5.8% CPR aggregate as even housing turnover slowed amid economic uncertainty. The lock-in effect was now reinforced by a confidence effect: even borrowers willing to accept rate-related moving costs were hesitant amid recession fears.

The April tariff volatility created a moderate convexity event. 10yr rate volatility spiked to levels not seen since October 2023, forcing significant convexity hedging from servicers and portfolio managers. Duration on UMBS 6.0% whipsawed between 5.3 and 6.5 years depending on the day's rate level, making hedge ratios unreliable and increasing transaction costs. Swaption implied volatility (1y10y) jumped ~15bps in April before partially normalizing in May-June.

## Housing & Credit

The tariff shock visibly cooled the housing market. Existing home sales fell back to ~4.00M SAAR, erasing Q1's gains. Builder confidence (NAHB index) dropped to ~38, the lowest since 2022, as lumber prices surged 20%+ on Canadian tariffs and appliance/material costs rose on Chinese tariffs. Housing starts fell to ~1.25M SAAR—a genuine pullback that would constrain future supply.

Case-Shiller decelerated to approximately +2.5% YoY, the slowest since 2019. Months of supply reached 4.5 months. Prices remained resilient in absolute terms but the growth trajectory was clearly decelerating, and some Sun Belt markets (Austin, Phoenix, Boise) showed quarter-over-quarter price declines.

Delinquency rates edged to 3.9% (30+ days), with FHA delinquencies at ~9.0%, the highest since the COVID-era peak. Not alarming given the employment picture (unemployment at 4.3%) but worth monitoring. The question for credit is whether tariff-driven price increases and potential layoffs in trade-sensitive sectors (manufacturing, agriculture) push marginal borrowers into stress.

## Non-Agency & Structured Products

CMBS issuance of ~$20B was below trend as CRE uncertainty compounded macro uncertainty. Office CMBS delinquencies exceeded 9%. Non-agency RMBS of ~$16B showed some caution. CLO issuance slowed to ~$35B as leveraged loan spreads widened.

Agency CMO issuance was ~$35B, below recent averages, with reduced appetite for complex structures during high-volatility periods. Floater demand remained as investors used them for rate hedging.

## Key Events & Narrative

**Liberation Day was a market earthquake.** The April 2 tariff announcement was the single most impactful policy event for markets since COVID. For mortgage markets specifically, the dual impact was rates up (inflation expectations) and confidence down (recession expectations)—the stagflationary cocktail that makes the Fed's job impossible and borrowers' decisions agonizing. MBS widened, housing activity dropped, and the fragile recovery narrative from late 2024 was shattered.

**The Fed is paralyzed.** Two holds and counting. Powell's language—"well-positioned to wait"—translates to "we have no idea how to model tariff-driven inflation and we're not going to guess." For mortgage borrowers hoping for rate relief through Fed cuts, this was a devastating message: even if the economy weakens, the Fed may not cut if tariffs are keeping inflation elevated. The worst of all worlds.

**GSE privatization meets macro reality.** It's one thing to talk about privatizing the GSEs during a stable-rate, low-vol environment. It's another to do it when MBS spreads are 48bps wide and the macro outlook is genuinely uncertain. The RFI was constructive process-wise, but market participants increasingly questioned whether 2025 was the right time to introduce structural uncertainty into the world's largest securitization market. Our view: the administrative groundwork continues, but actual capital raises or IPO activity is a 2026-2027 event at the earliest.
