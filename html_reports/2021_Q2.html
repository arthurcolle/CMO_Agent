<div class="narr"><div class="ct" style="margin-bottom:12px">Full Quarterly Recap</div><h3 class="sh">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Q2 2021 delivered a head-spinning combination of dovish rate action and hawkish Fed rhetoric that left MBS investors simultaneously gorging on compression and bracing for tapering. The quarter began with 10-year Treasuries at 1.74% and ended at 1.45%—a ~30bp rally that nobody saw coming after the reflation tantrum of Q1—while Fed Chair Powell engineered the most consequential hawkish pivot since taper talk in 2013. The June dot plot shocked markets with two hikes penciled in for 2023 (up from zero in March), and Powell's careful verbiage around "talking about talking about tapering" signaled the beginning of the end for the Fed's $40B/month MBS purchase program. Yet paradoxically, MBS spreads ground tighter to generational lows of 10-12bps OAS as Fed dominance overwhelmed all other technicals. Meanwhile, the housing market entered full mania mode with Case-Shiller up 16.6% YoY, origination volumes topped $1T for the quarter at record levels, and lumber briefly kissed $1,700/mbf before collapsing. The Supreme Court threw FHFA leadership into chaos with the Collins v. Yellen ruling, Calabria was promptly fired, and Sandra Thompson took the reins as Acting Director. For MBS traders, Q2 was a masterclass in cognitive dissonance: enjoying the tightest spreads in memory while watching the Fed lay groundwork for its exit.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Treasury Market: The Rally Nobody Expected</h3>
<p>After the reflation tantrum drove 10s from 90bp to 1.74% in Q1, consensus headed into Q2 positioned for higher rates and steeper curves. Instead, we got a classic "bad news is good news" rally that took 10s down to 1.45% by late June. The 2s10s curve flattened modestly to ~130bps as the market oscillated between competing narratives: transitory inflation (Powell's mantra) versus sustained overheating (bond vigilantes' fear). When CPI printed 5.0% YoY in May—the hottest reading since 2008—Treasuries initially sold off, but the move reversed as traders concluded the Fed would look through supply chain bottlenecks and semiconductor shortages. The real action came at the June FOMC when the dot plot shifted hawkishly, projecting two hikes in 2023 versus zero previously. Powell's press conference threaded the needle, acknowledging "talking about talking about tapering" while reiterating the "substantial further progress" hurdle hadn't been met. The 10-year rallied 5bp on the day—a counterintuitive response that reflected relief the Fed wasn't moving <em>immediately</em>. Real rates plunged to -90bp, a level that would've been unthinkable pre-pandemic. For MBS investors, the rally was a gift: duration extended, convexity improved, and prepayment speeds decelerated from torrid Q1 levels. The quarter proved once again that predicting rates is a fool's errand, but riding the trend is profitable.</p>
<h3 class="sh">MBS Spreads: Fed Dominance and Historic Tightness</h3>
<p>MBS nominal spreads to Treasuries compressed to 10-12bps OAS by quarter-end, the tightest levels since the early 2000s and well inside pre-pandemic norms of 30-50bps. The driver was simple: Fed dominance. With the Fed purchasing $40B/month in gross MBS (plus reinvestments bringing the total closer to $60-70B/month net impact), the central bank was absorbing roughly 120-140% of net new supply. Private investors were effectively being crowded out, forced to chase into Ginnie Maes, lower coupons, or specified pools to find any semblance of value. The current coupon oscillated between 2.0% and 2.5% as rates bounced around, with 2.0s trading at explicit premiums and 2.5s fighting to stay above par. OAS on 2.0s briefly went negative on a swaps basis as dollar rolls traded exceptionally special—traders were paying up to borrow collateral for TBAs. The roll specialness reflected the Fed's insatiable bid: why settle when you can defer delivery and collect financing income? Higher coupons (3.0s and above) cheapened in relative value as prepay fears subsided with the rate rally, but even there, spreads were historically tight. Some context: in 2018, with the Fed shrinking its balance sheet, MBS OAS blew out to 70-80bps. Now, with a balance sheet approaching $2.35T in MBS and growing, spreads were one-sixth that width. The compression created a binary outlook: either you believed the Fed taper would blow spreads out 20-30bps (our base case), or you believed structural demand from banks and money managers would keep spreads anchored. Either way, Q2 was not the time to be short spread product.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Primary Market and Origination: Record Volumes in Full Swing</h3>
<p>Origination volumes in Q2 topped $1T, cementing 2021 as a record year. Refi activity remained robust at ~$600B (60% of volume) despite the rate rally pulling many borrowers back into the money; MBA's refi index stayed elevated, though off the nosebleed highs of late 2020. Purchase originations clocked in near $400B, propelled by the strongest housing market in a generation. Home prices surged 16.6% YoY per Case-Shiller, inventory languished at 2.0 months (well below the balanced market threshold of 5-6 months), and existing home sales ran at a 5.8M SAAR pace. First-time buyers were being priced out, but millennials and upgraders kept bidding wars alive. On the agency issuance side, gross production exceeded $500B, with the Fed gobbling up the lion's share. Specified pool pay-ups, which had traded at absurd levels in 2020 and early 2021, began to moderate as generic pools performed well and prepay volatility declined. Low balance (LB) pools still commanded +2-3pts of pay-up, but the bid for low loan balance, high LTV, and investor property pools softened as speeds normalized. From a credit perspective, the GSEs were printing money: Fannie reported $5.3B in Q2 net income, Freddie $3.0B, driven by benign credit losses and reserve releases. CRT issuance restarted after the COVID pause, with ~$5-6B priced YTD, signaling confidence in the underlying collateral. Forbearance continued to decline, dropping to 3.6% of loans (~2.0M borrowers), down from pandemic peaks above 8%. The primary market was a well-oiled machine, and originators were harvesting record profits.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Housing Market: Mania, Lumber, and Affordability Collapse</h3>
<p>The housing market in Q2 was objectively insane. Double-digit price appreciation, bidding wars with 20+ offers, appraisal waivers, and cash buyers dominating. Case-Shiller's 16.6% YoY gain understated the frenzy in hot markets like Phoenix (+25%), San Diego (+22%), and Boise (moonshot territory). Inventory at 2.0 months meant anything remotely desirable sold within days. Housing starts ran at 1.59M SAAR, but supply chain bottlenecks and labor shortages constrained builders. The real spectacle was lumber prices, which spiked to $1,700/mbf in May—up from ~$500 pre-pandemic—adding $36k to the cost of a new home before collapsing by quarter-end. The surge and crash epitomized the "transitory inflation" debate: was this a temporary supply shock or a harbinger of sustained overheating? For mortgage strategists, the housing mania had mixed implications. On the one hand, booming home prices bolstered credit quality and reduced LTVs, making GSE portfolios bulletproof. On the other hand, rising prices and rates (even at 2.96% average for 30-year mortgages) were eroding affordability, potentially capping purchase demand in future quarters. The median home price hit $350k, requiring a household income of ~$75k assuming 28% debt-to-income ratios—far above median household income. The music was still playing in Q2, but the exit doors were looking smaller.</p>
<h3 class="sh">FHFA and GSE Developments: Calabria Out, Thompson In</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court's June 23 ruling in Collins v. Yellen reshaped FHFA leadership in dramatic fashion. The Court held that FHFA's single-director structure with for-cause removal protection violated separation of powers, effectively ruling the President can fire the FHFA Director at will. Within hours, the Biden administration fired Trump-appointed Director Mark Calabria and installed Sandra Thompson as Acting Director. Calabria's tenure had been marked by efforts to recap and release the GSEs, increase capital requirements, and reduce the government footprint in housing finance—initiatives that died with his departure. Thompson, previously head of FHFA's Division of Housing Mission and Goals, signaled a more borrower-friendly, mission-focused approach. The policy shift was immediate: talk of GSE privatization evaporated, and affordable housing goals took center stage. From a market perspective, the leadership change reduced near-term uncertainty around GSE reform (read: punted it indefinitely) but raised questions about capital standards and guarantee fee pricing. Meanwhile, the adverse market fee implemented on April 1—a 50bp charge on refi loans $125k-$500k—began generating revenue for the GSEs, though its impact on borrower behavior was muted given how deep in-the-money many refis remained. Fannie and Freddie continued printing record earnings, underscoring the absurdity of their conservatorship status. CRT issuance resumed, transferring modest credit risk to private markets, but the GSEs remained 100% government-backed in all but name.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Fed Policy and the Tapering Setup</h3>
<p>The June FOMC was the pivotal event of Q2, marking the Fed's first hawkish pivot since the pandemic. The dot plot shift—two hikes now projected for 2023 versus zero in March—caught markets flat-footed. Powell's press conference was a rhetorical ballet, introducing the phrase "talking about talking about tapering" to signal the Fed was beginning internal discussions about reducing asset purchases. The message was clear: $120B/month ($80B Treasuries, $40B MBS) couldn't last forever, and with the economy recovering and inflation running hot (CPI hit 5% in May), the time to plan an exit was approaching. Powell emphasized the taper would be gradual and telegraphed well in advance—lessons learned from the 2013 taper tantrum. For MBS investors, the implications were stark. When the Fed eventually tapered, likely beginning in late 2021 or early 2022, spread widening was inevitable. How much? Our estimate: 20-30bps on generic MBS, with higher coupons underperforming. The second-order effect was prepay volatility; reduced Fed buying would restore two-way markets and reintroduce convexity hedging flows. In Q2, with the Fed still in full-buying mode, these concerns were theoretical. But the setup was undeniable: enjoy the tightest spreads in a generation while they last, because the party has an expiration date.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Outlook and Trading Implications</h3>
<p>Looking ahead, Q3 will likely bring continued tapering chatter, with Jackson Hole (late August) the potential venue for a formal announcement. Spreads at 10-12bps OAS offer little compensation for the coming volatility, and we see the risk/reward as asymmetric: maybe 2-3bps tighter, but 20-30bps wider if tapering is announced. Our bias is to reduce MBS exposure relative to credit or structured products offering better carry. On coupons, we favor 2.5s and 3.0s over 2.0s; the roll specialness in 2.0s is crowded and vulnerable to a Fed signal change. Specified pools remain interesting but expensive; the pay-up compression in Q2 suggests much of the value has been harvested. On duration, we're neutral; the 10-year range of 1.25%-1.75% feels sticky, with breakevens anchoring the front end and growth concerns capping the long end. Housing remains a wildcard—if affordability constraints bite hard, origination volumes could roll over faster than expected, reducing supply and paradoxically supporting spreads. But the base case is a normalization: slower refis, moderating purchase volumes, and wider MBS spreads. Q2 was a gift for carry traders and anyone long convexity into the rate rally. Q3 will test whether investors can exit before the Fed does.</p></div>
