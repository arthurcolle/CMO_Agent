<div class="narr"><div class="ct" style="margin-bottom:12px">Full Quarterly Recap</div><h3 class="sh">Executive Summary</h3>
<p>Q1 2023 will be remembered as the quarter where mortgage-backed securities moved from supporting actor to center stage in the most acute banking crisis since 2008. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10—precipitated directly by $17 billion in unrealized losses on its $91 billion MBS portfolio—sent shockwaves through financial markets and paradoxically catalyzed one of the most dramatic flights to quality into Agency MBS in recent memory. While the quarter began with the Fed's relentless hiking campaign grinding housing activity to multi-decade lows and mortgage rates hovering in the mid-6% range, the banking turmoil that erupted in the back half of March fundamentally reshaped the technical backdrop. Agency MBS spreads tightened nearly 10bp to ~35bp post-crisis as investors fled bank credit risk for the safety of government-backed paper, even as the Fed maintained its $35 billion monthly runoff and delivered two 25bp hikes that brought the funds rate to 4.75-5.00%. The quarter closed with mortgage rates at 6.54%, the 2s10s curve inverted by 90bp, housing turnover near cycle lows, and a nascent debate about whether unrealized MBS losses across the banking system would force the Fed to reconsider its QT stance.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Rate Environment and Fed Policy</h3>
<p>The Federal Reserve entered Q1 with its foot firmly on the brake, delivering 25bp hikes at both the February 1 and March 22 FOMC meetings to bring the target range to 4.75-5.00%. The February hike was consensus and uneventful. The March 22 decision, however, came just days after the SVB failure and proved deeply controversial—the Fed chose to prioritize its inflation fight even as it simultaneously launched emergency liquidity facilities to contain banking contagion. Chair Powell's messaging attempted to thread the needle, acknowledging "recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions" while maintaining that "the Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks."</p>
<p>The 10-year Treasury told the real story, averaging ~3.60% for the quarter but experiencing violent intra-quarter swings. Yields reached 3.92% on March 2 as strong payrolls data suggested higher-for-longer, then collapsed 54bp to 3.38% in the week following SVB's failure as markets aggressively priced in Fed cuts. The 2s10s spread inverted to -90bp as the 2-year crashed from 4.9% to 3.8% post-SVB, reflecting market expectations for Fed pivot. Meanwhile, the 30-year mortgage rate averaged 6.36% for the quarter, starting at 6.42% in January, dipping to 6.09% in February on rate rally hopes, then backing up to 6.54% by quarter-end as primary-secondary spreads widened on banking uncertainty. The 15-year rate averaged 5.57%.</p>
<p>The Fed's balance sheet management continued methodically despite the crisis, with MBS holdings declining to ~$2.57 trillion as the $35 billion monthly cap remained in effect. This proved increasingly awkward as the banking crisis exposed the systemic damage caused by underwater MBS portfolios across the regional bank complex.</p>
<h3 class="sh">The Banking Crisis and MBS at the Epicenter</h3>
<blockquote class="bq">*The danger we flagged in Q3 2022 — that $600B in unrealized bank MBS losses represented a solvency risk if deposit flight forced asset sales — materialized in exactly the way we described. The feedback loop between Fed QT ↔ MBS basis ↔ bank unrealized losses ↔ deposit stability broke at SVB, then threatened to cascade through the entire regional bank complex. This is the most consequential manifestation of feedback loop #1 (Fed balance sheet ↔ MBS basis) since we began tracking it in 2014 Q1. The instrument long considered the safest in fixed income outside Treasuries became the vector for the worst banking crisis in 15 years — not because the credit was bad, but because the duration risk was catastrophic and the accounting was permissive.*</blockquote>
<p>March 2023 will join September 2008 and March 2020 in the annals of financial crisis history. Silvergate announced voluntary liquidation on March 8. SVB failed March 10. Signature Bank was seized March 12. Credit Suisse required emergency UBS merger March 19. First Republic teetered. The proximate cause of SVB's collapse was brutally simple: a $91 billion MBS and Treasury portfolio sitting on $17 billion of unrealized losses, purchased at the height of the pandemic bond bubble with depositor money that suddenly fled when rates rose.</p>
<p>The irony was acute—Agency MBS, long considered the safest, most liquid fixed-income instrument outside Treasuries, became the instrument of destruction for poorly risk-managed regional banks. SVB's portfolio was heavily concentrated in long-duration MBS purchased at 2.0-2.5% coupons in 2020-2021, now worth 15-20 points underwater. When deposit flight forced asset sales, realized losses vaporized capital instantly.</p>
<p>The crisis revealed that SVB was merely the worst of a widespread problem. Across the banking system, particularly among regional banks, hundreds of billions in unrealized MBS losses sat lurking in HTM portfolios. What was intended as patient, hold-to-maturity balance sheet management became a ticking time bomb when deposit beta proved higher than expected.</p>
<p>The Fed and Treasury's response was swift. The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) launched March 12, offering loans against Treasuries and MBS at par value rather than market value—essentially creating a liquidity backstop that allowed banks to avoid realizing losses. FDIC guaranteed uninsured deposits at SVB and Signature. The message was clear: no systemic unwind would be permitted.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Agency MBS Technicals: Flight to Quality</h3>
<p>Against this chaotic backdrop, Agency MBS delivered exceptional relative performance. MBS option-adjusted spreads tightened from ~45bp at quarter start to ~35bp post-crisis, dramatically outperforming spread product as investors rotated into government-backed paper. This 10bp tightening occurred despite the Fed continuing its $35 billion monthly runoff and mortgage origination remaining weak—a testament to the severity of the flight-to-quality bid.</p>
<p>The bid came from multiple sources: money market funds rotating out of bank paper into short MBS, bank treasurers buying MBS (ironically, after selling caused the crisis), foreign reserve managers seeking AAA paper, and opportunistic real-money accounts capitalizing on dislocations. The convexity profile that had punished MBS in 2022's rate selloff became an asset in March's volatility spike—as rates plunged, MBS didn't extend as much as feared given the high-rate environment had already killed prepays.</p>
<p>Current coupon production centered on 5.5% and 6.0% coupons. Specified pool pay-ups collapsed to near-zero as liquidity concerns dominated—the market wanted TBA liquidity, not specification risk. Lower coupons (2.5-4.5%) sat deep underwater but exhibited minimal prepayment risk, creating attractive carry for patient capital.</p>
<p>Bank MBS holdings became the subject of intense scrutiny. Regional banks' HTM portfolios were marked-to-market by equity analysts even if not by GAAP accountants, and bank stock performance became tightly correlated with MBS portfolio underwater percentage. The sector that had been MBS's most reliable bid for decades suddenly represented a structural overhang.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Housing and Origination Markets</h3>
<p>The housing market continued its post-pandemic normalization-cum-freeze. Existing home sales remained pinned near 4.0 million SAAR—the lowest levels since 2010—as the lock-in effect kept move-up buyers on the sidelines. Why sell a home with a 3.0% mortgage to buy at 6.5%? This dynamic kept inventory at just 2.6 months despite slowing demand, preventing the sharp price correction many had anticipated.</p>
<p>Case-Shiller home price appreciation decelerated sharply to ~2.0% year-over-year with negative month-over-month readings becoming common. Markets varied widely—Western markets that had experienced the largest pandemic gains (Phoenix, Las Vegas, Boise) saw outright price declines, while supply-constrained markets (New York, Miami) held better. Housing starts averaged 1.37 million SAAR, supported by single-family construction but pressured in multifamily as rent growth decelerated.</p>
<p>Mortgage originations totaled approximately $300 billion for the quarter, split roughly $140 billion purchase and $160 billion refinance (29% refi share). The refi activity was concentrated in streamline/VA IRRRL products and cash-out refis for borrowers who bought pre-2020 and still had equity cushions despite rate increases. Rate-term refis were essentially dead with the back book sitting on 3.0-4.0% mortgages.</p>
<p>Credit quality remained pristine with delinquency rates around 1.0%—near historical lows—supported by strong home equity positions, tight pandemic-era underwriting, and a still-healthy labor market. The GSEs reported solid Q1 earnings: Fannie Mae ~$3.8 billion, Freddie Mac ~$2.4 billion, driven by book growth and declining loss reserves as home prices stayed elevated.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Credit Risk Transfer and Non-Agency</h3>
<p>The Credit Risk Transfer (CRT) market experienced significant volatility during the banking crisis. Spreads widened sharply in mid-March as liquidity evaporated and investors questioned bank balance sheet capacity to warehouse credit risk. Typical M2/B2 tranches that had been trading in the 200-250bp range blew out to 350bp+ at the height of the crisis before recovering to 275-300bp by quarter-end.</p>
<p>Issuance slowed to a trickle in March as the GSEs pulled back, though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both maintained they remained committed to the CRT program. The structural bid from banks—historically 30-40% of CRT demand—was notably absent during the crisis, replaced partially by hedge funds and CLO managers.</p>
<p>Non-Agency origination remained muted. Jumbo lending continued for high-FICO borrowers in expensive markets, but Non-QM and investor loan production stayed suppressed. The banking crisis exacerbated this trend as portfolio lenders pulled back and securitization execution became challenging. Spreads on existing Non-Agency paper widened 50-100bp during the crisis, with lower-rated tranches particularly impacted.</p>
<p>The silver lining: credit fundamentals remained sound. Home price declines were orderly, borrower equity cushions substantial, and employment solid. Delinquency ticks in Non-Agency pools remained benign. The spread widening was technical, not fundamental, creating attractive entry points for patient capital.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Prepayments and Convexity</h3>
<p>Prepayment speeds remained at generational lows, with 30-year MBS CPRs running in the low-to-mid single digits for seasoned 3.0-4.5% coupons. The quarterly average for Fannie Mae 30-year 3.5% coupons ran around 5-6 CPR—extraordinary sluggishness reflecting the 300-350bp rate disincentive to refinance. Even borrowers with credit events (divorce, job loss) were increasingly pursuing alternatives (home equity loans, assumptions) rather than full refinance.</p>
<p>Higher coupons (5.5-6.0%) produced to service elevated rates showed modest but rising turnover as the purchase market created organic prepays. These pools exhibited 15-20 CPR, dominated by purchase activity rather than rate refi. Housing turnover remained the primary driver of prepayments across the stack.</p>
<p>The March rate rally created brief prepayment anxiety—would the 54bp Treasury move bring rate refis back into the money? The answer was largely no. Even at 5.8% mortgage rates (the March low), the refi population remained limited to post-2022 borrowers. Model-based duration extensions that had plagued MBS in 2022 proved less severe in Q1, with investors appreciating that the structural prepayment slowdown was durable.</p>
<p>Convexity hedging flows stayed manageable through the quarter. The speed of the March rate move created some reactive hedging, but the overall convexity supply was modest compared to 2022. Servicers' hedge books had already extended significantly, and the high absolute rate level kept duration extension less severe than historical parallels would suggest. The MOVE index spiked to 190+ during the crisis, but MBS negative convexity proved less problematic than feared.</p>
<h3 class="sh">Outlook and Positioning</h3>
<p>As we enter Q2, the mortgage market faces profound uncertainty around three key questions:</p>
<p><strong>First, will the banking crisis force Fed pivot?</strong> The market spent late March pricing in 75-100bp of cuts by year-end. If banking stress intensifies and credit conditions tighten materially, the Fed may be forced to pause or even cut despite above-target inflation. This would be bullish for rates but comes with recession risk. Alternatively, if the crisis is contained and inflation remains sticky, the Fed could maintain restrictive policy longer, pressuring housing further.</p>
<p><strong>Second, will the Fed adjust QT?</strong> The $35 billion monthly MBS runoff has removed a critical bid. With banks' appetite for MBS damaged by crisis-related scrutiny and capital requirements, who absorbs Fed runoff? If secondary market spreads widen enough to threaten housing, the Fed may slow or pause QT. We're watching the 30-year primary-secondary spread carefully—sustained moves above 250bp could force Fed response.</p>
<p><strong>Third, how deep and long is the housing recession?</strong> Existing home sales are running 30% below 2019 levels. Starts are holding up but face headwinds from tighter bank lending standards post-crisis. The lock-in effect suggests multi-year turnover suppression. This is bearish for home prices (fewer transactions = price discovery challenges) but bullish for MBS prepayments (low speeds support valuations). Origination may settle into a $1.2-1.4 trillion annual range—half the pandemic peak.</p>
<p><strong>Positioning:</strong> We favor current coupon MBS at +35bp OAS, representing fair value for the prepayment risk and still wide to pre-2022 levels. Lower coupons (3.0-3.5%) offer attractive carry for patient capital with minimal prepay risk—these are 15+ year duration assets at this point. We're cautious on CRT given bank bid impairment but see value in recent widening. Higher coupons (6.0-6.5%) face modest prepay headwinds if rates rally but offer strong carry.</p>
<p>The banking crisis has permanently altered MBS technicals—the reliable bank bid is impaired, Fed runoff continues, and unrealized losses across the system create overhang. Yet Agency MBS proved its mettle in March, delivering precisely the flight-to-quality performance investors needed. With 30-year rates at 6.5%, carry is attractive and prepayment risk minimal. The question is whether housing can stabilize at these affordability levels or whether further price discovery lies ahead.</p>
